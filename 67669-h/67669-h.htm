but those who should recognize
beneath the feigned name of Lady
Fitzhenry, one whom they may remember
to have seen in the gay scenes of

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Towards</span> the end of a London spring,
that is to say, about the middle of August,
was married by special license,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>at her father’s house in Harley Street,
Emmeline Benson to Ernest, Lord Fitzhenry,
only son of the Earl of Arlingford.</p>
<p class='c014'>The ceremony was like most others
of its kind; the drawing-room was
crowded with relations and friends on
both sides, dressed in congratulatory
smiles, and new bridal finery.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline’s father, an opulent city
merchant and banker, appeared arrayed
in a complete new suit for the occasion.
The first gloss was not off his coat,
which hung stiff upon him, as if not
yet reconciled to the homely person to
which it was destined to belong, while
each separate bright button reflected
the collected company. His countenance
glowing with happiness, he busied
himself in attentions to his guests, provoking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>by his remarks, those congratulations
which flattered his pride and
parental fondness; and, with bustling
joy, making the necessary preliminary
arrangements for the ceremony about to
take place, which was to raise his only
and beloved child to that elevated situation
in life, in which it had ever been
the first wish of his heart to see her
placed, and which his partial affection
thought her so well fitted to grace.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Benson’s feelings seemed of a
less joyous nature, and sometimes, even
a tear started into her eye, in spite of
herself, when she endeavoured to smile
in return to the kind wishes of her
friends. She was too fond a mother not
to feel painfully the loss of her daughter;
and that feeling was not unmixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>with anxiety, in giving her to one of
whom (of late years at least) she personally
knew but little.</p>

<p class='c014'>All were now assembled excepting
the bride and bridegroom. The father
of the latter, apparently as much delighted
as Mr. Benson himself with the
intended union, being of course among
the company. But Lord Fitzhenry did
not appear! Various conjectures were
formed as to his absence. One person
declared he had observed his carriage at
the door of his lodgings as he had
passed; another, that he was certain he
had seen him in a distant part of the
town not long before. The delay was beginning
to be awkward, and at every distant
sound of wheels, both fathers looked
anxiously along the street, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Gradually the conversation of the
guests lowered itself into whispers, as
some new surmise was started with regard
to the possible cause of this strange
absence of the most important personage
at so important a moment. But even
these whispers died away from lack of
new ideas on the subject, and the now
total silence was only occasionally
broken by the rustling of the clergyman’s
surplice, when he left his post before
the large family prayer-book (laid open
ready at the marriage ceremony) with
the benevolent wish, by some commonplace
observation, to dissipate the unpleasant
feelings which seemed to infect
all present; or when he followed Mr.
Benson to the window, whither he had
taken up his station of observation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the hopes of being the first to give the
much wished-for news of the approaching
bridegroom. Poor Mrs. Benson’s
cheeks became momentarily of a deeper
and deeper dye, and she betrayed her
anxious agitation by the nervous twitching
of the gold chain round her neck,
to which was suspended her daughter’s
portrait, and the constant arranging of
her lace shawl, which she regularly each
time pulled off her shoulders. At last,
the welcome rattle of a carriage driving
furiously was heard. It stopped at Mr.
Benson’s door, and in a minute Lord
Fitzhenry, with a flushed cheek, hurried
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Awkward as such an entrance must
naturally be, still his agitation seemed
even beyond what the circumstances of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the moment would have been likely to
produce on a young man of the world.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry, at twenty-seven, was
remarkably good-looking; and on his
countenance and whole figure was that
stamp of high birth, which, even where
beauty does not exist, more than compensates
for its absence. The general
character of his countenance was that of
openness and good humour; but an
agitated, even a melancholy expression
now clouded it, which all noticed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Marriage is certainly an awful ceremony,”
whispered an elderly lady to
Mrs. Benson; “and I am glad to see his
lordship betraying so much feeling and
seriousness at such a moment. It is a
good sign in a young man.” The poor
trembling mother scarcely heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>remark, nor was there much time for
more observation, for Mr. Benson had
already left the room, and in a few
minutes returned, leading in his daughter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline was nineteen. She was
slightly formed, had a most winning
countenance, innocent laughing eyes,
and a delicate, fair complexion, although
now deepened into crimson, in
her cheeks, by the agitation of the moment,
as was very apparent, even through
the folds of the beautiful lace veil that
hung all over her.</p>

<p class='c014'>The marriage ceremony commenced
immediately. As it proceeded, the
bridegroom trembled violently. When
called upon to pronounce his vow, his
voice was scarcely audible; and as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>placed the ring on his bride’s hand, he
nearly let it fall to the ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>But all was soon finally said and
done—so few are the words which, once
read over, totally change our existence,
and fix our fate in life for ever! The
usual congratulations passed, and the
chaise and four, decorated with bridal
favours, rattled to the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline threw herself sobbing into
her mother’s arms—the first sob, since
those of childhood, which had ever been
wrung from her light heart. Her proud
father gaily kissed her cheek, addressing
her by her new title of “Lady Fitzhenry;”
then, drawing her arm within
his, hurried her down stairs, placed her
in the carriage, into which the bridegroom
followed, and the “happy pair”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>drove off as fast as four post horses
could convey them.</p>

<p class='c014'>How blank such moments are to those
who remain behind! The company soon
separated after the usual breakfast, and
Mr. and Mrs. Benson were left alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>All excitement, over the deserted mother’s
spirits then sank; mournfully she
paced the now silent room, and mechanically
removed from the table Emmeline’s
work-box, which she had left
behind her, gazing on her name, engraven
on the lid, till her tears burst
forth. Her distress roused Mr. Benson
from the trance of exultation in which
he had been lost as he watched the last
bridal carriage that had driven from the
door, and he kindly hastened to his
wife.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Why, my good woman, crying!
and on such a day! when you should be
so happy—for shame! for shame!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Benson shook her head mournfully.
“God grant it indeed <i>prove</i> a
happy day! may our beloved child be
so!” and she sighed deeply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, how can you doubt she will?”
said her husband; “she has every thing
this world can give; rank!” (and he laid
a great stress on that word,) “riches,
youth; and, for a husband, a most excellent
and accomplished young man, of
whom every one speaks well. None of
your gamblers, jockies, spendthrifts. I
am sure Emmeline and ourselves are the
envy of all our acquaintance. Any one
might be pleased and proud to see his
daughter so well married.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Mrs. Benson again sighed, wiped
away her tears, and then quietly returned
to her usual avocations.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile, Lord and Lady Fitzhenry
travelled on, and a few hours brought
them to Arlingford Hall, which, on his
son’s marriage, Lord Arlingford had
given up to him, meaning to reside
himself at a villa at Wimbledon; his
health, which had of late been very precarious,
making a near residence to
town advisable.</p>

<p class='c014'>Arlingford Hall, which was in Hampshire,
had been completely repaired and
refurnished for the new married couple;
Lord Fitzhenry having himself been
much there lately, superintending the
alterations. At least, that occupation
was always mentioned as an apology for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>his absence from town, and for his not
attending more assiduously on his future
bride.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the journey, Lord Fitzhenry’s
agitation and abstraction rather encreased,
and it could no longer escape
Emmeline’s observation. His conversation
was forced; in his manner towards
her he was punctiliously attentive and
civil—but perfectly cold and distant.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they arrived at Arlingford, all
the servants were assembled in the hall
to receive them; a numerous and respectable
group, who, by the tears of joy
which some of them shed, seemed most
sincerely to partake in the supposed
happiness of their young master. One
of them, who stood apart from the rest,
even ventured to address him with particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>congratulation as with the familiarity
of an old friend, and to give
Emmeline his blessing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you, Reynolds, thank you,”
said Fitzhenry hastily, as he shook the
old man by the hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline’s heart was cast in nature’s
best mould, and this simple action of
her husband found its way to it. She
smiling raised her tearful eyes to his
face, but the expression she there found,
soon made her again cast them down.
The scene seemed to have totally discomposed
him; and, in an awkward,
hurried manner, thanking the rest of
the servants, he led the way to the
drawing-room. Dinner was ordered
directly, and all seemed so zealous to
serve their young master and mistress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>that it was not long coming, but still
there was an awful pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry walked up and down
the room, forced himself to speak, then,
suddenly, as if recollecting that some
degree of gallant attention was to be
expected from him, a bridegroom of only
six or eight hours, he hurried up to
Emmeline and helped her off with her
shawl; but his manner was so odd, so
unlover-like, that it at last alarmed even
her innocent, unsuspecting mind, and
she timidly asked if he was not well.
He started at her question, and seemed
much embarrassed; but, after a moment’s
pause, replied, “The journey,
the hurry, I suppose; indeed, I hardly
know what, but something has given me
a dreadful headache.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>And then, as if roused by her remark
to a sense of the strangeness of his behaviour,
he put more force upon himself,
showed her the public rooms, her own
sitting room, in which were collected
books, musical instruments, and every
possible means of amusement. In answer
to her enquiries, explained to Emmeline
who were her new relations that
hung framed on the walls; and, when
she admired the comfort of the house,
and particularly of her own boudoir, he
said something about hoping she would
be happy in it, but the phrase died
away in uncertain accents.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dinner at length came to his relief;
he then was attention itself, but the repast
could not last for ever; and, when
the servants had left the room, Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Fitzhenry’s embarrassment returned
worse than before. Emmeline had lived
so little in society, and, consequently,
had so little the habit of general conversation—and
the six years during which
she and her husband had been separated,
had so entirely broken off the first
intimacy which had existed between
them when children, that, timid in his
company, and now unassisted and unencouraged
by him, she felt it impossible
to keep up any thing like conversation.
It was, therefore, no small relief
when, after an awkwardly protracted
silence, she saw him leave the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the door closed upon him, Emmeline
involuntarily fell into a reverie not
of the most pleasing nature. “This is
all very strange!” thought she; and over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>her usually gay countenance a sadness
crept. She sighed, she hardly knew
why; and, when her thoughts wandered
back to her former happy home, her
parents, and their doating fondness,
some “natural tears” stole down her
cheek, and she felt herself, as in a dream,
neglected and deserted.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Emmeline was not <i>in love</i>; and
her husband’s behaviour, though it astonished
her, and though she felt it was
not what it ought to be, did not wound
her heart as it otherwise would have
done.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline was very young, even for
her age. With a most superior mind and
character, with tender, even romantic
feelings, her innocence and simplicity of
heart were so great, and all her qualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>had as yet lain so dormant, that her character
was scarcely known even to herself;
and, to common observers, she passed
for a mere gay, good-humoured, pleasing
girl. She was, however, no common
character, nor what one would have supposed
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Benson to have been. Nature sometimes
seems to amuse herself with playing
such fanciful tricks; and Emmeline’s
natural superiority made it appear as if
she had been thrown into a sphere totally
different from that for which she
had been originally designed, and that
she now was only restored to her own
proper station, when raised, by her
marriage, to be the companion of Fitzhenry.</p>

<p class='c014'>To explain how such a being came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>be thus passively united to a man who
seemed already to have repented the
step he had taken, it will be necessary
to go back a little in our narrative.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Lord Arlingford</span> had, early in life,
entangled himself in pecuniary difficulties
by every species of thoughtless extravagance,
in which an expensive,
fashionable wife had assisted him. Her
fortune and health both soon declined,
and a consumption rapidly carried her to
the grave while still in the prime of life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and when her only child, Ernest, was but
ten years old. That which extravagance
began, indolence soon completed; and
long before his son came of age, Lord
Arlingford found himself, in the language
of the world, to be totally ruined.</p>
<p class='c014'>Mr. Benson had been always much
employed and consulted by Lord Arlingford’s
family in all matters relating to
business; and to him, in the present desperate
situation of his affairs, his lordship
was obliged to have recourse for advice
and assistance. Mr. Benson had toiled
all his life as a merchant, and was
now one of the most opulent bankers
in London. He had an only child; and
to her he meant to bequeath all his
wealth, provided she made a marriage
to his choice; by which, he meant one in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>that rank of life, which, with
all his useful good sense, he had the folly
to imagine essential to human happiness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Being every way an excellent man of
business, Mr. Benson was appointed to
be one of the trustees, into whose hands
it was now deemed necessary to consign
Lord Arlingford’s estate; in order, if
possible, to retrieve his affairs, and protect
the interests of his son.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day, when talking over his difficulties
with his client, and when Emmeline
was but seven years old, Mr. Benson
first proposed, in the form of a joke,
as a means by which all might be set to
rights, that their children should be
united in marriage. He finished his
speech by a loud laugh; but it was one
of mere agitation, for he anxiously looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>into Lord Arlingford’s face to see how
such a proposal agreed with the ancient,
aristocratic pride of the Fitzhenrys.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Arlingford for a minute made no
reply; he kept his eyes fixed on the
parchment he held in his hands. The
table before him was covered with deeds,
bonds, mortgages, and every awful sign
of the irretrievable state of his affairs;
and, strange as it may appear, he caught
immediately at the idea, as to that which
alone could save him from utter ruin. His
answer, when at last it came, transported
the ambitious banker with joy; and by
degrees, and by constantly treating of the
subject, the two fathers seemed to think
it was a matter they had but to settle
between themselves, and that there could
be no difficulty whatever in a scheme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>which was to give to both, what they
both wanted. Mr. Benson’s promises
were most liberal, and Lord Arlingford
subdued all the hereditary pride of his
feelings, and seemed quite content to
lay himself and his family under obligations
to a man on whom he in return
conferred so much honour.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a first step towards bringing about
this favourite scheme, Ernest, when at
home for his holidays, was constantly
sent to Mr. Benson’s, where he was of
course indulged in his every boyish
fancy, and every species of amusement
imagined for him in which little Emmeline
could take a part.</p>

<p class='c014'>On her birthday every year, a ball
was given by Mrs. Benson, which was
opened by her and young Lord Fitzhenry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>while the two fathers looked on in
admiration, and declared that they were
born for each other.</p>

<p class='c014'>At twenty, Fitzhenry left Oxford; he
was then to remain abroad for three
years; and, at his return, it was settled
that the marriage should take place;
although as yet, nothing had been said
on the subject to either of those most
concerned in the plan.</p>

<p class='c014'>Before his departure, however, Lord
Arlingford thought it proper to open the
business to his son, and also to lay before
him the embarrassed state of his affairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such disclosures make little impression
on young minds, to whom, as yet
unacquainted either with its value or
want, money is but a vague sort of blessing;
and Lord Arlingford was forced to
overcharge the picture to give it due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>influence on his son. He talked much
of his own distresses, his sacrifices for
the sake of his dear Ernest, and, when
he had worked on his filial affections,
mentioned merely as a passing thought
the long projected plan of his union with
Miss Benson. Ernest, starting, coloured,
and stammered out some undecided
words. But finding no <i>positive
objection</i> made, Lord Arlingford pushed
on the affair—praised Emmeline—(then
only thirteen years old,) extorted from
Ernest first, that he thought her a fine
girl, and at last a sort of agreement that
he would think of the proposal, and, on
his return from abroad, marry her, and
make his father happy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Benson was informed of the favourable
progress of their scheme, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he furthered by every means in his
power; and Emmeline was soon taught
to look upon Ernest as her future husband.
On his taking leave of them before
his departure for the Continent, he
kissed her smooth young cheek, addressing
her by the name of his little
wife. But neither the kiss nor the appellation
brought even an additional
tinge of colour into that cheek; although
she might childishly have grieved at the
loss of her almost only companion.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the first months of his absence,
Lord Fitzhenry wrote two or three times
to Emmeline, once when sending her a
watch from Geneva, and again with a
chain from Venice; but he soon found
more interesting occupations than composing
letters for the capacity of a mere
child: the boy had grown into a man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and if he did not actually forget the engagement
into which his father had
drawn him, he allowed it but little to
occupy his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry first visited Italy; at
Naples, he formed an intimacy with the
English minister then residing there;
and, on the removal of that minister to
Vienna, Ernest followed him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The three years allotted for his residence
abroad, had already nearly
elapsed; but, having acquired a taste for
the habits of the Continent, Ernest begged
for longer leave of absence; and by
his letters, no less than by the accounts
of all those who met with him, his foreign
life seemed so much to have improved his
mind and manners, that Lord Arlingford,
whose purely worldly character saw little
beyond such acquirements, agreed to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>prolonging his stay; and he was the
more willing to acquiesce in his son’s
wishes, as Emmeline, scarcely yet sixteen,
was still in appearance and manners
so much of a child, that any contemplation
of her immediate marriage
would have been premature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry, at twenty-three, with
excellent and even superior abilities,
naturally noble feelings, strong sentiments
of honour, and a warmly affectionate
heart, wanted only those serious principles
of conduct, which his father had
neither bestowed on, nor ever required
from him. Had Lord Arlingford been
asked whether or no he was an atheist,
he would have resented the question as
an affront; but, nevertheless, religion
had never occupied his own thoughts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and had never in any distinct form entered
into the education of his son. The
companion he selected for him during
his residence on the Continent, was a
young man of considerable abilities, who
had been destined for the law; but who,
having been early led abroad, and having
a decided turn for a wandering life, was
too happy to return to scenes in which he
delighted, and to give up Lincoln’s Inn,
and studies, for which he had no relish,
for the existence he preferred, in present,
and the future chance of Lord Arlingford’s
patronage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such a companion, gay and thoughtless
as himself, was not likely to supply
the neglected part of Lord Fitzhenry’s
education; and thus, although gifted by
nature with a mind and heart formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>for virtue, in its highest acceptation,
Fitzhenry was turned adrift on the world
without any help or defence against its
snares, except those common rules of
worldly honour by which men, who may
infringe nearly every law, human and
divine, fancy themselves to be guided.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Vienna, Lord Fitzhenry became
acquainted with Lady Florence Mostyn,
and that chance acquaintance influenced
his whole future life and conduct.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Florence, who had early in life
been married to a man whom she had
never loved, and whose understanding
and character she could not respect, had
every allurement, every charm to captivate,
except that of innocence. Such a
deficiency one might have hoped would
have preserved a refined mind like that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of Fitzhenry’s from her chains; but, under
the influence of passion, artfully excited,
and the example of the society in
which he lived, he fell completely into
the snare purposely laid for him, and became
the slave of an artful, bewitching,
and violent woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the intoxication of her society,
every thing was forgotten or disregarded.
In vain were his father’s repeated injunctions,
that he should return home;
in vain his self-reproaches at losing, in
idleness, some of the best years of his
life. And it was only when alarming accounts
of Lord Arlingford’s health roused
his better feelings, that he was induced to
tear himself away from Greece, whither
Lady Florence and her passive, accommodating
husband had accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>him; and, in the middle of winter, to
set off for England with the hope and
promise that they would join him there
early in spring.</p>

<p class='c014'>Six years had now elapsed since Lord
Fitzhenry had left home. His person,
character, manners—all had changed.
His “Little Wife” was nearly forgotten;
and when she did chance to cross his
mind, he looked upon his engagement
with her as a mere joke of childhood, and
trusted his father would do the same.</p>

<p class='c014'>From Italy, where he found the accounts
of Lord Arlingford were still very
alarming, he travelled day and night to
make up for past negligence, and found
his parent on his arrival, but slowly recovering
from a very dangerous illness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Real feeling and affection broke forth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>from Fitzhenry’s selfish, worldly father,
on again beholding his son; and beholding
him, as in truth he was, a son to be
proud of.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Arlingford’s illness, by weakening
his nerves, had given to his manners
an appearance of sentiment unusual to
him; and Ernest almost wondered how
he could have been such a monster as so
long to have deserted him. A constant
visitor in his father’s sick room, he found
Mr. Benson. With a feeling not unmixed
with remorse he warmly thanked
him for having supplied his place, and
inquired after Mrs. and Miss Benson, as
after old friends of his boyhood.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, quite well,” said Mr. Benson;
“but Emmeline is so grown, that you will
hardly know her again: however she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>is not altered in any way, I assure you;
she has not forgotten her old playfellow;”
and he looked cunningly into Fitzhenry’s
face, to observe the effect of this
flattering assurance. “You have been
a sad rambler, Lord Fitzhenry,” he continued;
“but now you are returned to
old England, we shall, I hope, all live
comfortably together; and I am sure
you will be quite delighted with Emmy,
although perhaps she is not just like your
foreign madams; but none the worse for
that I suspect—they don’t make such
good wives; and now that you have, as
I may say, sown your wild oats,” he
added with a laugh, “you will not be
sorry to sit down at home and enjoy a
little home-bred, quiet English comfort.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry saw but too plainly the drift
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of all this, and he was totally at a loss for
an answer. His eyes, fearful of meeting
those of Mr. Benson, wandered round
the room, till they fell on a view of Naples
which hung over the chimney. The
sight was not favourable to the picture of
<i>English happiness</i> which Mr. Benson had
just been presenting to him. Hours of
rapture produced by the first intoxication
of passion, beneath an Italian sky, and
amid scenes calculated to enhance every
feeling of romantic enjoyment, rose up
before him in an instant, and formed such
a contrast to the homely, domestic comfort
just held out to him, that his very
soul sickened at the thought; and, making
some awkward sort of vague answer
to Mr. Benson’s <i>very pointed</i> remark, he
abruptly left him.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Ernest had expected to have found his
father irritated against him, in consequence
of his long absence and his frequent
excuses for not obeying his summons
to return home. He also feared
that the real cause of his protracted stay
might have reached England, and he
dreaded how much of his story, since
they had parted, might have been made
known to Lord Arlingford. But the
manner of his father was so perfectly kind
and cordial, that it reassured Ernest as to
his secret being as yet safe, and at the
same time filled his affectionate heart
with gratitude and self reproach.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some days after his arrival, when
talking on various subjects connected
with the place, estate, &amp;c., Lord Arlingford
suddenly said, “Mr. Benson, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>soon as I am a little better, and fit for
visitors, you must write in my name, and
invite Mrs. Benson and Emmeline to
come here. Ernest must be impatient
to see his little wife. Eh, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Ernest did not parry this second attack
any better than the first—he started,
and stammered out something about
“pleasure, honour.” But his father did
not, or would not, see his reluctance to
touch on the subject; he returned again
and again to the charge, said his happiness,
his life even, depended upon the
marriage; and by the nervous irritation
which illness had produced, and which
opposition to his will increased, Ernest
feared he spoke truly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Harassed and perplexed, Ernest at last
took courage, and resolved to confess to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>his father the attachment he had formed
abroad—his unalterable, violent, decided
devotion to another. Lord
Arlingford seemed breathless with anger
and anxiety, and imperatively
desired him to inform him who was the
object of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry cleared his voice, rose
from his chair, paced the room, and
twice, in vain, tried to speak; but at
last making an effort, “she is a married
woman,” he said, “Lady Florence
Mostyn.” The name was scarcely audible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And is that <i>all</i>?” replied his father,
much relieved. “Don’t think you are
telling us any thing new; we have heard
of your pranks abroad, my boy; but you
will not make the worse husband for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>having passed through the fire. And as
for your <i>unalterable</i> attachment, that is all
nonsense. So I thought, at your age,
with <i>my</i> first love; for I had two or three
<i>affairs</i> of the sort before I was married;
and, indeed, never quite forgot one of
my favourites.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely, Sir, with such feelings——!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Feeling! stuff again,” replied Lord
Arlingford. “Why really, Ernest,
you have learnt little of the world in
your travels; I am sure any one of your
young friends would laugh to hear you
give such a reason for refusing a most
excellent, and, I must add, advantageous
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Although without principles, Ernest
was shocked at his father’s levity; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was in all the heroic romance of passion;
to love more than one, to plight his faith
to another, did not strike him as morally,
religiously wrong, but as sacrilege to
the one adored being. All he could obtain,
however, was delay, and that his
father would allow him some little time
for reflection.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus passed some months. Lord
Fitzhenry occasionally met the Benson
family; but Emmeline he hardly looked
at, hardly noticed; although, when in
her society, his manner towards her was
perfectly civil; but it was the civility of
indifference; his thoughts were fixed on
another, and had he been asked the
colour of Emmeline’s hair or eyes, he
probably could not have answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>Spring arrived, and with it Lady Florence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>This event did not further Lord
Arlingford’s plan. Fitzhenry was more
and more decided in his objections, and
in his determination not to fulfil what
his father called his engagement.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many violent altercations passed between
them, and, at last, in one of these
agitating scenes, Lord Arlingford was
seized with an apoplectic fit, and (as
Ernest thought) fell dead at his feet.
Horror-stricken, he raised him from the
ground; medical assistance was procured,
and life and hope returned after
some days of dreadful apprehension and suspense; but the impression left
on his mind was too strong to allow of further resistance; and, in an
unguarded moment, Fitzhenry, attacked on every side, gave his reluctant
consent to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>hated union. His father allowed him
no time to retract. His proposals were
immediately made; though not without
a secret hope, on Fitzhenry’s part, of
their being rejected, which, owing to
the marked neglect with which he had
ever treated her whose hand he claimed,
seemed not unlikely. But, contrary to
his expectations, his offer was accepted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline, as has before been stated,
was remarkably young and innocent for
her age; she had been brought up in
the idea that Lord Fitzhenry was to be
her husband; and, although without any
very decided preference for him, and
with a heart perfectly free, she had
looked to her marriage as to a thing of
course, and as to an event that was to
secure her happiness.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>His indifference, however, had not
escaped her observation; and, her cheek
reddening with offended pride, she mentioned
it to her father, when, breathless
with delight, he came to announce
to her that Lord Fitzhenry claimed her
as his bride.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Benson ridiculed what he called
her conceit, her romance; exaggerated
into compliments many a simply <i>civil</i>
thing which Fitzhenry had, or possibly
had <i>not</i>, said of her; set forth all the advantages
of the marriage; used every argument
which he knew her affectionate
deference to him would give weight to;
even hinted at his word being pledged,
till he succeeded at last in silencing her
doubts and scruples. The good and
pious Mrs. Benson too was not quite
free from worldly vanities; she told herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and she told Emmeline, that so
good a son must make a good husband;
that it would be such a comfort to see
her settled in life with one whom she
had known since a boy, and of whom
she knew so much good.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last, with something between a
smile and a sigh, Emmeline gave her consent,
and all was thus finally arranged:</p>

<p class='c014'>Seven thousand a-year was firmly
settled on Lord Fitzhenry, and the residue
of Mr. Benson’s immense property
promised at his death. He added likewise
a <i>few thousands</i> of ready money for
plate, jewels, equipages, &amp;c.; “in order,”
as he said, “to set the young people
a-going.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Every one was satisfied but poor
Ernest. To his feelings, all this was
hateful; and he was doubly shocked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>when he found, during the legal details
into which he had now to enter, that
Arlingford Hall, the abode of his childhood,
although it had been long in the
family, yet from not being entailed like
the rest of the property, had only been
saved by Mr. Benson’s liberality; and,
that in the involved perplexity of his father’s
affairs and the urgency of his creditors,
all the expenses of his late election
had been defrayed from the same
source.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sick at heart, as soon as he could extricate
himself from lawyers and papers,
Ernest signified his intention of leaving
town, in order, as he let it be understood,
to superintend the repairs at
Arlingford, but, in fact, to fly to Lady
Florence, who was still in the country.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>It was their first meeting since his
marriage had been declared; and with
an unprincipled, impassioned woman, he
had to undergo scenes still more agonizing
than those with his father.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry’s love for Lady Florence
was far beyond her power of appreciating—unable
to do justice to his character,
she could not trust to such devotion
as he expressed, and as he really felt.
He believed that for his sake she had
sacrificed both honour and virtue, and
his whole life, his every affection, he
conceived would hardly repay the debt.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ernest’s heart was capable of love of
the purest, noblest kind; and, even
towards so unworthy an object, it partook
more of the nature of his own
character than of her’s who had inspired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>it. During the period employed in preparations
for his nuptials, instead of
attending on his bride, Fitzhenry never
left Lady Florence. Her power seemed
strengthened by the very circumstances
that should have lessened it; he accompanied
her to town; and, even the
morning of his marriage, on her entreating
to see him, if but for a moment, he
had flown to her bewitching presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>A most violent scene ensued; it ended
by a solemn vow on his part to remain
true to her, his first, his only love, in
thought, word, and deed. That Emmeline
should merely be the mistress of
his house; that, in public, he should behave
to her with perfect attention and
civility, but nothing more.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hardly knowing what he did, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>till long after the hour appointed for the
celebration of his nuptials, he left Lady
Florence for Mr. Benson’s house.
Hence his flushed cheek, and his agitated
manner, the too true indications
of his troubled soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry had no distinct religious
feelings; but still, when he heard the
sacred vow he was to pronounce, (and of
which he had never thought,) with his
lips still vibrating with that he had
pledged to Lady Florence; no wonder
those lips quivered. Although no dread
of the anger of his God appalled his
mind, yet, as a man of honour, he felt
the atrocity of the act. Of Emmeline,
of the poor victim, who stood trembling
beside him, he hardly thought. He
looked upon her as a mere obedient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>child without a character; perhaps, even
worse, an ambitious, worldly being; and
all his thoughts, all his compassion,
were bestowed on Lady Florence and
himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry wanted neither decision
nor character. During their melancholy
journey to Arlingford Hall, he
had sufficiently surmounted his agitation
to have decided on his conduct.
He resolved to tell all to Emmeline, to
let her fully enjoy the honours, the
worldly advantages of the situation he
thought she had in her union with him
sought; to assure her he would ever endeavour
to make her happy, but that she
must never hope for his affections.</p>

<p class='c014'>Often, after an awful pause, he resolved
to speak, but each time his courage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>failed him; and finding all explanation
by word of mouth impossible, he
then resolved on writing to her. It was
to compose this letter, therefore, that,
after dinner, he left his bride, as has
before been said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such a letter was not easily written;
and Emmeline had some time to ruminate
on her situation, before he returned.
At last he came. He seemed in the
feverish state of one who has taken a
desperate resolution: he hurried up to
Emmeline; asked her if she was not
fatigued? if he should ring for candles?
and then, without waiting for an answer,
rung the bell violently till it broke. His
hand shook so much, that he tried in vain
to tie the string together again. Emmeline
smiling said, she supposed she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>more used to strings and knots, and
begged to assist him. As she took the
cord, her hand accidentally touched his—it
was icy cold.</p>

<p class='c014'>Reynolds, the old servant, brought
in the candles, and asked, if his lordship,
“if my lady,” would not have any
supper? any wine and water? “Yes,
some wine directly,” said Fitzhenry, as
if hardly conscious of his demand.</p>

<p class='c014'>When it came, he endeavoured to
pour out some for Emmeline; but twice,
from the nervous shaking of his hand,
he was forced to put down the bottle.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline was really alarmed. “Surely,”
again, she said timidly, “you are
very unwell.” He did not seem to heed
her, but drank off a large goblet of wine,
and then, with a steadier voice and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>manner said—”I have something on my
mind which I must make known to you—perhaps
I should have done it sooner—I
thought it best for both of us to write
it,” and he held out his letter—”Take
it with you into your own room,” he
added, seeing she was going to break
the seal. He took up a candle, gave it
her, went with her to the door, put his
hand on the lock, and said—”When
you have read this, forgive me if you
can;” then hastily seizing her hand,
which he almost convulsively grasped,
he left her.</p>

<p class='c014'>What poor Emmeline’s feelings were,
can be better imagined than described.</p>

<p class='c014'>In one short moment, a thousand
vague fears and horrors passed through
her mind. It was <i>her</i> turn now to tremble,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>as, with the dreaded letter in her
hand, she hurried to her own room.
She there found her maid, whose presence
disconcerted her much; but she
resolved to take off her gown speedily,
and then dismiss her. Never before,
she thought, had her attendant been so
slow and tedious. She entangled or
pulled every string into a knot. At
last, her gown off—that beautiful lace
gown in which her poor mother had that
morning, with so much pride, arrayed
her—all her bridal finery laid aside,
she told her maid she wanted nothing
more.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing more, my lady!” said the
maid astonished; “shall I not put up
your ladyship’s hair? Shall I not wait
to take away your candle? Mrs. Benson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>desired me to”——and she stopped
short.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I want nothing,” again said
Emmeline, in a voice she could hardly
command. The woman stared, busied
herself still some time in the room, and,
at length, reluctantly departed.</p>

<p class='c014'>When she was gone, Emmeline sat
for several minutes with the letter in her
hand, before she had courage to open
it. At length, taking a violent resolution,
she broke the seal, and read as
follows:—</p>

<div class='lh c011'>

<p class='c015'>“When you have read this, you will,
I fear, be tempted to upbraid and curse
the writer; but I act according to my
conscience, to my sense of honour, in
imparting to you what I am going to unfold—at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>least, you shall not <i>now</i> accuse
me of deceiving you—I think, I trust, I
never have done so; for little as you
have, I believe, lived in the world, still,
unless purposely, artfully concealed from
you, you must have been aware, that
my affections have long since been disposed
of, and that, at my return from
abroad, they were no longer mine to
bestow.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Under such circumstances, I never
should have renewed the offer of my
<i>hand</i>; but parental authority, and the
distressing and perplexing situation in
which I found myself placed, extracted
from me my consent to our marriage.
But even in so doing, I did not attempt
to <i>deceive</i>. You cannot accuse me of
having, in any way, endeavoured to gain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>your affections. You saw me as I was,
indifferent to you, and you were at liberty
to refuse me: but you were content to
become my wife on these terms—that is
to say, of bearing my name, and sharing
the poor advantages which rank affords.</p>

<p class='c016'>“These you still <i>may</i>, still <i>shall</i> enjoy:
but nothing more can I offer
you; for every feeling of my soul is
another’s—forgive me for saying so; but
this is no moment for disguise of any
sort. To that other, I am bound by
every tie, every vow of affection and
honour. You will be shocked at hearing
such sentiments from <i>me</i>—from your
<i>husband</i>; but I should consider myself
to be indeed the unprincipled villain you
may deem me, if, with such feelings, I
could, for a minute, look upon you in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>other light than that of a sister. I know
full well what love is; and you do not, cannot
love me. Therefore I feel not your
injuries to be what they otherwise would.
You shall enjoy all the worldly advantages
you have sought in your marriage with me—all
the happiness which wealth—your
own wealth—can bestow; and it shall be
my endeavour, as far as I can, to make
your life happy. You shall be completely
mistress in your own house, and
of all your actions. Your comfort shall
ever be consulted; and I think can
venture to say for myself, that you
may depend on my kindness, and even
on my friendship; but my affections as
a <i>lover</i>, as a <i>husband</i>, while the same
heart beats in my breast, can never be
yours.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“If I may venture, claiming no other
right of a husband, to make a request,
it is that this subject may never, in any
way, directly or indirectly, after this
fatal day, be mentioned between us.
With regard to your own parents, and to
my father, your own good sense and
delicacy will, I dare say, dictate to you
what conduct to pursue. But if you
cannot agree to these, I confess humiliating
terms—if you desire an immediate
separation, you have but to name your
wishes. I will tell all to the world, bear
all the blame, and agree to any arrangement
which you and your father may
choose to dictate.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Whatever you have to say, write immediately,
and put your letter into the
adjoining room. In a short time all will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>be at rest in the house. I will then myself
go for it. If possible, every thing
must be fully settled and understood
between us before we meet to-morrow
morning.</p>

      <div class='line'>My husband! no not mine—but we were wedded;</div>

</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>All</span> those who have had trials in this world—and
who has not?—must know that
there are moments in our life during which
we seem to live centuries! and that a few
hours sometimes are sufficient to rouse,
influence, and form a character for ever.</p>
<p class='c014'>So was it with poor Emmeline! She
who had never known a sorrow—she
who had looked to her future life as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>one scene of bright enjoyment, on a sudden
saw the picture changed, and beheld
nothing but trials, disappointment,
mortification, and sorrow. She had at
once to decide, and on one of the most
important steps probably in her life,
without a single friend to counsel and
uphold her: and he, who should have
been that friend, that support, was the
one against whom she had to arm herself,
and exert energies of character, of
which she did not even know herself to
be possessed.</p>

<p class='c014'>What Fitzhenry had said was true—she
did not love him; that is to say,
was not <i>in love</i> with him; but she had
entertained a sort of girlish affection for
the companion of her early youth, and
it was impossible not to admire the handsome,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>accomplished, informed being he
now was. Her innocent mind adding
to these prepossessions, the light in
which she had ever been taught to consider
him, of her future husband, gave
to her feelings something sacred and
tender, so that she had looked to her
union with him with stronger anticipations
of happiness, than those which
mere obedience to her father’s wishes
could have given.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry’s letter fell from her hands,
and almost hysteric sobs escaped from
her heart. “What have I done to be so
cruelly used, so scorned, so upbraided!”
she could not help ejaculating; and
again she seized the fatal letter. “He
despises me for having trusted him; he
even reproaches me for that, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>he alone is to blame. She would leave
him; leave those paltry honours which
he thought had been her object; leave
him that wealth which had been the motive
(she could no longer doubt it) of her
having been sought in marriage by him;
and with the vehemence of indignant
feeling, she directly seized on a pen, in
order to demand an immediate and total
separation.</p>

<p class='c014'>But scarcely had she written the first
word, when, with the natural timidity
of a young girl, she shrunk from the
responsibility and <i>enterprise</i> of so desperate
a step, and from all the publicity
which she would, by it, draw on herself.
She laid down her pen; pressed,
with both hands, her throbbing temples,
as if to quiet their agitated pulsations;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and then, returning to the fatal
letter, she perused it again and again,
till gradually her most angry feelings
were calmed. She <i>could</i> not curse him—<i>would</i>
not upbraid him. His language
to her, though harsh, was so open, so
honourable! and then, with the happy
buoyancy of youth, and of an innocent,
unbroken mind—”I will make him love
me yet,” she thought—”I will so consult
his wishes in every thing; so play my
hard part, that he shall see I am not
the mere child, the worldly insensible
fool he thinks me; he must in time love
me, and we shall still be happy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was what her <i>feelings</i> dictated;
and this line of conduct she told herself
her duty to her parents required of her.
She would not break their hearts by letting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>them know how they had been deceived;
but, for their sakes, she would
submit to her fate.</p>

<p class='c014'>Happy in having thus reconciled her
duties to her inclinations, she could not
help picturing to herself <i>that</i> future to
which, with such fortunate credulity, she
fondly looked, when she should have
overcome her husband’s unfavourable
opinion of her, and won his affections;
and, in indulging such flattering dreams,
Emmeline sat some time lost in thought,
till roused by the sound of hurried steps
in the adjoining room. That room was
Lord Fitzhenry’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>The drawing-room opened into a gallery,
the first door in which, was that of
Emmeline’s dressing-room; her bedroom
was beyond; and beyond that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>again, but, having no communication
with Emmeline’s apartment, was Lord
Fitzhenry’s; it had been his when a
boy; and that now allotted to Emmeline
had been his father’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sound of measured steps in that
room, like those of a person suffering
from impatience and anxiety of mind,
reminded her that she must answer her
husband’s letter. But, what could she
write? She took her pen, but for long
had not power to express a thought. At
last, not trusting herself to look a second
time at what she had said, she hastily
wrote, and folded up a paper, containing
the following words.</p>

<div class='lh c011'>

<p class='c015'>“I will not curse, I will not upbraid
you; yet I have been most cruelly used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and deceived. Your wishes shall be
laws to me. You need apprehend no
childish weaknesses or complaints on
my part. In time, you will learn better
to know her whom you have made your
wife. And to God alone shall I apply
for relief or assistance under any trial
that may assail me.</p>
<div class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Emmeline.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>She opened the door into the gallery—all
was silent. With hurried, trembling
steps, she went into the drawing-room,
placed her letter on a conspicuous
part of the table, involuntarily looked
round the room, as if to recall some of
those gay, bright anticipations with
which she had that day first entered it;
and then, with noiseless steps, regained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>her own apartment. As she went to it,
she saw light beneath the door of Lord
Fitzhenry’s room. Satisfied that he was
still up, and that he would look for her
letter, she closed her door, and sat
breathless, with flushed cheeks, to hear
him pass into the drawing-room for it.
In a little while, she heard him tread
softly along the gallery. At the door of
her room he paused—then went hastily
on. On his return, he again paused.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He listens,” thought Emmeline, “to
hear if all is quiet, and whether the insensible
fool whom he has made his wife
sleeps soundly;”—and tears of mortification
again made their way down her
face; again the door of her husband’s
room closed, and all was quiet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dawn of day found poor Emmeline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>in the same listening attitude in
which she had sat when Fitzhenry
passed her room—her hands clasped together,
her eyes fixed on vacancy. She
was roused by the extinguishing candle
falling into its socket, and looked up
astonished to see broad day light. She
went to the window to throw open the
sash, that the fresh air might cool her
eyes and cheeks: in drawing up the
blind for the purpose, the string caught
the rings on her finger. She started on
seeing her wedding ring, and, above it,
the circles of diamonds, rubies, &amp;c., the
presents of doating parents, and perhaps
envious friends, on the morning of that
ceremony, which was, they imagined, to
secure her future happiness. “Alas!”
thought she, “how they were mistaken!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Emmeline soon felt chilled by the
fresh morning air. She hastily bound
up her loose locks, laid herself on her
bed, and the fatigue of her mind, (a feeling
so new to her,) procured for her the
rest she needed.</p>

<p class='c014'>She awoke with that confused impression
of distress, which the unhappy
know so well; which oppresses the
mind even before we can clearly remember
what occasions it. Still she was
refreshed by those few hours of sleep,
and felt better able to encounter the
dreaded meeting with her husband than
she could have thought possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>She got up and rang for her maid.
From her window, she had seen Fitzhenry
out before the house, and she
hurried herself to be in the breakfast-room
before his return. While she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>dressing, she schooled herself in the part
she was to act, and resolved to meet
him with the unembarrassed kindness
of friendship. Had she had to expect
him <i>one</i> minute longer, her nerves would
have failed her; but she saw him hurry
towards the house. The servants had
fortunately left the room. She heard
his footsteps on the stairs, the door
opened, and in he came. He was
deadly pale; Emmeline went up to him,—held
out her hand. Hardly knowing
what she said, she made some remark
on the weather, the heat, and, without
pausing, in a hurried voice, asked him
some other indifferent questions.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry returned the pressure of her
hand, once looked in her face, apparently
with surprise; tried to speak,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and at last, in time, overcame his agitation;
but never again did his eyes meet
hers, or were they even ever raised
towards her. He had brought into the
room with him some greyhounds, apparently
as subjects for conversation.
They fawned and jumped on their master;
and the noise and bustle they made—the
feeding them, and Emmeline’s
endeavours to ingratiate herself in their
favour, was a something to do, and a
relief.</p>

<p class='c014'>During that melancholy breakfast, of
which neither eat, Emmeline was the
one who played her part the best. When
it was gone, Fitzhenry said, “I have
some letters I must write”—and, struck
with the possible interpretation of his
own words, he coloured deeply; “but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>they will soon be written,” he added
hastily, “and probably you too will wish
to write to tell your mother of your sate
arrival; and,”—again embarrassed, he
stopped short. However, in a minute, he
recovered himself, and said, “The post
leaves at one; after that, if the day continues
fine, you will perhaps like to go
out and see the place. I don’t know
what sort of a horsewoman you may be,
but I have a very docile animal, if you
will venture to mount him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline, who had ridden much,
and thought that that species of exercise,
with a groom attending, would, under
their awkward circumstances, be better
than a <i>tête-à-tête</i> walk, directly said she
had no fears, and would prefer riding.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus they parted; and Emmeline went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to her own room to write to her parents.
It was then that the melancholy of her
prospects overcame her with a bitterness
she had not before experienced.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had taken her pen in her hand—placed
the blank paper before her; but
the moment she was going to address
her mother, an involuntary burst of tears
escaped from her, and she laid her head
down on the table, unable to write; for,
alas! what could she write to that doating
mother? what feelings express, but
those of mortification, and the anticipation,
the conviction, indeed, of certain
future unhappiness to them as well as to
herself? Perhaps equally, if not more
poignant, would be the feelings of many
women, were they but a few years after
their fate in life is thus fixed, to re-peruse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the letters written during the early period
of their marriage, breathing nothing but
the belief of continued felicity and of
unalterable love. But no such even
transient dream of bliss existed to poor
Emmeline. Again she took her pen,
wiped away the tears that had blotted
her paper, and, as well as she could,
made out a letter to satisfy her mother’s
anxious heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no lover at her side, fondly
to follow each motion of her hand, each
thought that her pen traced, and with
the playfulness of overflowing love and
happiness, to guide that hand when, for
the first time, signing his name as her
own.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the hour fixed on for their ride
arrived, Emmeline went to the appointment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>with as cheerful a countenance as
she could command. Fitzhenry left it
to the groom to put her on her horse,
and never looked at her when mounted;
but, otherwise, was careful of her safety;
and this cold neglect on his part she at
the minute rejoiced at, as she had feared
he must have observed the trace of her
tears. The fresh air and a new and
agreeable country revived her spirits,
by nature at all times inclined to cheerfulness.
The awkwardness and mental
absence of her companion also a little
wore off, and, on the whole, they got
through the morning better than she had
expected.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry told Emmeline that his father
was coming to them the Wednesday
following, and that he had invited some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>friends for the end of the week. She rejoiced
to hear of these arrangements;
not but that her feelings towards that
father had much changed since the
truth had begun to break in upon her;
but then, any third person would be
such a relief!</p>

<p class='c014'>When she thought of the way in which
their honeymoon was to be passed—that
after hurrying away from town and the
world with all accustomed bustle—and,
although only married four and twenty
hours, they both already looked to society
for relief, the absurdity of their
situation struck her for an instant as so
ridiculous, that involuntarily a smile,
which she saw did not escape her companion,
stole over her features; but, as
it faded, a deep-drawn sigh succeeded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and she averted her head, to conceal
from Fitzhenry, the revolution of feeling
which she was conscious was painted in
her face. A long train of reflections
passed through her mind, as, absorbed
in thought, she carelessly with her whip
brushed from the bushes, as she passed
them, the drops remaining from a late
shower; and so deep was her reverie,
(the first almost in which poor Emmeline
had ever been lost,) that Lord Fitzhenry
twice spoke to her before she
heard him, and when she did, the tone
of her voice in answer, had in it, (perhaps
unknown to herself,) a something of
repulsive coldness, unusual to her. Whether
it so struck him or not, cannot be
ascertained; but the remainder of their
ride was performed nearly in total silence.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Emmeline at once wisely took to her
own occupations, and allowed her husband
to go his own way. It would be
often wise and prudent if even new-married
<i>lovers</i> did the same; for, shocked as
they may be at the idea, even real love
will at last become dull and wearisome;
and many a fondly devoted bride has,
I dare say, during the very first week,
often wished for her usual occupations,
as much as her lover has for his gun
and pointers. But with Lord and Lady
Fitzhenry, there was no form, no farce
of sentiment to keep up. Each felt happier
when apart from the other; and, by
having many an hour for reflection, Emmeline
was enabled to school her mind
to the trials to which she felt she must
be exposed—trials but too likely to increase;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>for gradually her irritated feelings
gave way. When Fitzhenry’s
letter, and its harsh expressions of determined
indifference towards her returned
to her recollection, then her
offended pride enabled her to act her
part with spirit; and she could talk, and
even laugh, with apparent gaiety, to
show him he had not had power to
wound her feelings deeply. For, amiable
as was Emmeline’s disposition,
enough of human infirmity lurked about
her—enough of the “Woman scorned,”
to allow her a degree of pleasure in mortifying
one, who had shown so little
scruple in more than mortifying her.</p>

<p class='c014'>At moments, too, her natural gaiety
was not to be restrained; and when, on
the third evening of their residence at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Arlingford, her laughing eye caught the
look of astonishment in the old butler’s
countenance, when, as he entered the
room, he found the supposed lovers occupied
with their books at opposite ends
of the apartment, apparently as unconscious
of each other’s presence as any
indifferent pair after a dozen years’ marriage,—she
could not command the inclination
to laughter that overcame her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry looked up astonished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am much diverted with what I am
reading,” said Emmeline, to account for
her sudden burst of mirth, (colouring at
the same time, with the consciousness of
her departure from truth,) although perhaps
not sorry of an opportunity of showing
him, that even in <i>his</i> society, when
so totally neglected by him, and after all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>he had said and done to depress her
spirits, she was still disposed to cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“May I ask what book you are reading,
that I may benefit also by the entertainment,”
replied her husband.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps you would not be equally
amused by it,” said she. “Sometimes
little things tickle our fancy, without
our being able to say why; and much
depends on the humour we are in.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry looked a little disconcerted,
and Emmeline could not be so
generous as to regret it.</p>

<p class='c014'>But in his society, she soon ceased
to show either spirit or triumph; soon
forgot to be angry. The mildness of
his manners, the charm of his conversation,
when sometimes for a little he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>seemed to forget their peculiar situation,
and to give way to his natural habits and
disposition, soon won upon Emmeline,
and, with a sigh, she thought, “How
she <i>could</i> have loved him!” When galloping
on before her, and when certain
she should not be observed, her eyes
were fixed on his manly, graceful figure,
and she admired the ease, and indescribable
<i>elegance</i> (if one may use a word
so degraded) of all his actions.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is something in the manners
and conversation of an intelligent man of
the world, which it is impossible adequately
to describe,—which, without
being either information or wit, pleases
more than either. It is, perhaps, the
art of giving to each subject no more
than its due proportion of time and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>thought, which prevents conversation
from becoming tedious, and hinders any
idea, however serious, from weighing too
heavily on the mind. Fitzhenry possessed
this art in a superlative degree;
and Emmeline, to whom such conversation
was almost totally new, and who
by nature was formed to appreciate every
refinement, was powerfully captivated
by it. And, added to this, there was a
certain foreign gallantry of manner, (that
among her father’s acquaintance she had
certainly never experienced,) and a habit
of attention to women, which, in
Fitzhenry, was so strong, that his behaviour,
even to Emmeline, partook of it—to
her, whom he never looked at, nor
apparently noticed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole plan of his present life, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>footing upon which he meant Lady Fitzhenry
and himself to live together, was,
perhaps of foreign growth. A true-bred
Englishman would never have behaved
with the civility of good breeding to a
wife so forced upon him. He could
never have thought it possible to have
established any one in his house on the
terms on which Emmeline was to be
placed. But although Lord Fitzhenry
looked upon the observance of English
customs in a total retirement after marriage
as particularly irksome, it never
could make him wanting in respect, and
even in kindness, to one of Emmeline’s
sex. His will once made known,—told,
as it had been, very plainly and decidedly,—there
was nothing more to
settle between them, and he behaved to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>her with that sort of general observance
and attention due from a man to a
woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>In short, he could not help being agreeable,
although differing so cruelly from
the animated, enthusiastic Fitzhenry,
known to his friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps such conduct was more calculated
to excite despair than even apparent
dislike would have been to one,
who, like Emmeline, aimed at winning
his love; but, quick as she was, her
inexperience prevented her from being
aware, that these attentions of civility
were paid by him from mere force of
habit; she therefore gave way to the
charm which daily captivated her, and
did not always suspect that those words
on which her ear delighted to hang, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>which sometimes even wore the semblance
of gallantry, were uttered by him
generally in total absence of mind, with
his thoughts fixed on another.</p>

<p class='c014'>Who that other was, Emmeline no
longer doubted. Something she recollected
having heard of Lord Fitzhenry’s
admiration for Lady Florence Mostyn,
when abroad; but he had then been
so long out of England, Emmeline’s
thoughts were little occupied about him,
and the intelligence had made but slight
impression on her young mind. Now,
putting various circumstances together,
she could no longer doubt that Lady
Florence was her favoured rival, if indeed
a rival she could be called, where
there was no competition.</p>

<p class='c014'>For, much as Emmeline might wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>to propitiate her husband, and though
even a little vanity and pique might enter
into the feeling, yet she had no idea of
any of the arts of coquetry, and if she
now exerted all her powers of agreeableness,
it was from the simple wish
to make their present melancholy life
pass as well as the awkward circumstances
in which they were placed allowed.
If she might hope <i>in time</i> to
<i>win</i> her companion’s <i>affections</i>, she gave
up, as perfectly hopeless, all attempts to
<i>captivate</i> his imagination. And that very
feeling made her more at ease, and
therefore more agreeable than she could
otherwise have been. On all general
subjects, Fitzhenry was more than willing
to converse. The publications of
the day opened a wide field for discussion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>It was neutral ground, on which
they could meet and parley. There was
a peculiar liveliness, and originality in
all he said, which Emmeline was not
only able to appreciate, but, by taking up
his ideas with quickness, to encourage
fresh remarks, and even improve upon
them. The merits of Sir Walter Scott,
Miss Edgeworth, and Southey, were all
thoroughly commented upon. Lord Byron
came too near home, and, as if
by mutual consent, they always avoided
him and his writings.</p>

<p class='c014'>One evening—the last they now had
to pass alone—Emmeline had somehow
wandered in her conversation to Italy;
but she immediately observed a cloud of
recollections darken her husband’s brow,
and, making rather an awkward retreat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>she resumed the book she was reading,
and which had given rise to her unlucky
remark; and never took her eyes from it
till the usual time for retiring to her own
room. Fitzhenry had also remained silent;
but the moment she moved, he
started up as if roused from a reverie,
lit her candle for her and wished her
good night, hoping the slight headache
she had complained of would be better
next day. The tone of his voice was
so agreeable, the expression of his
countenance so mild, that she felt with
Juliet,</p>

<div class='lh c011'>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“Parting is such sweet sorrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I could say good night till it be morrow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>When she reached her own room, unconscious
of what she did, she leant her
head on her hand, and stood thus for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>some time at the chimney-piece, on
which she had placed her candle, lost
in thought. Had she been asked what
those thoughts were, perhaps she could
not have defined them; but at length, a
deep sigh escaped her as she ejaculated
to herself “How pleasant he is! and if so
to me, whom he dislikes, despises, what
must he be to her, to whom his whole
mind and heart are laid open? With me
it is almost impossible to avoid forbidden
subjects—Italy, I see, I must never touch
upon. Not only the present but the past
belongs to Lady Florence; <i>I</i> am only
connected with the future in his mind,
and a future to which he looks with dislike
and dread.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day was that on which they
expected Lord Arlingford; and Emmeline,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>when she met her husband at breakfast,
was concerned to see that all those
miserable, agitated feelings, which had
apparently much subsided, had now returned
worse than ever. During that
meal, he was so hurried, so abstracted,
that when after it was over, he had
placed himself at the window to read
the newspaper, she ventured to go up
to him, and purposely said something
about his father’s arrival, hoping that she
might dispel the anxiety which seemed
to oppress him, by showing him how
little Lord Arlingford’s presence would
add to her awkward feelings. She
therefore, to open the subject, asked at
what time he thought he would arrive.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry, without taking his eyes off
the paper, said he did not expect him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>till dinner-time—there was a pause, Emmeline
not knowing well how again to
begin—at length, Fitzhenry himself broke
the silence by saying, “Had you not
better write to Mr. and Mrs. Benson, and
propose their making us a visit here soon?
You will probably be anxious to meet
them before long.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you very much,” exclaimed
Emmeline, quite moved by the kindness
of his proposal, and feeling as if she could
have seized with affection on the hand
that rested on the edge of the window
near her. For a minute, the temptation
was strong; her breath came quick, and
the blood rushed into her cheeks. But
those cruel words in Fitzhenry’s letter,
“my affections can never be yours,”
flashed like lightning across her mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and prevented her from forgetting herself.
Still lost in thought, there she
stood. It seemed as if he felt the awkwardness
of the moment, and made a
motion to go. “Perhaps then you will
give me a frank for my father,” she said
timidly, and wishing to detain him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly, with pleasure;” and he
sat down to the table to write it. As he
gave it her, his hand trembled. Again
Emmeline’s better judgment failed her—again
her feelings, unused to concealment,
got the better of her prudence.
Sorry to observe his excessive perturbation,
and wishing as far as she could
to alleviate it, while taking the frank
from his hand, and without raising her
eyes from the writing, she said in a tremulous
voice, “Don’t distress yourself——indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>you may trust me.” Alas! these
words had the direct contrary effect from
what she had meant and hoped. Fitzhenry
started up, and hurried out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What have I done!” thought poor
Emmeline, as the door closed upon him.
“I have forgotten my promise, broken
my word—I have displeased him!” and
she sank on the chair he had quitted.
She hoped he would return; but he did
not come. She then thought she would
write to him, but, fortunately, nothing
which she could express, satisfied her feelings;
and, at length, she resolved that
she would rather try and make him forget
one unguarded word, by never referring
to it, and never again so offending.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sadly she retired to her own sitting-room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and saw no more of Fitzhenry, till,
at their usual hour for riding, a servant
came and told her the horses were ready,
and that my lord was at the door waiting
for her. Emmeline hurried down stairs.
She dared not even look at her husband,
for the wish to please had begun already
to make her timid; but, by the tone of his
voice, she soon judged that all <i>anger</i> at
least, if ever entertained against her, was
gone. He even exerted himself more than
usual to talk on indifferent subjects.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Arlingford arrived to dinner—Emmeline
met him with the cordiality
of a daughter. He seemed in high spirits,
delighted with her, with the improvements
in the house, with every thing.
Many a time, did the blood rush into
Emmeline’s cheek at the allusions he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>made to their late marriage, his railleries
on the honey moon, and such common
hackneyed subjects, which, trifling as
they are, generally possess a power of
pleasing where happiness really exists,
but which to her and Lord Fitzhenry
were torture. She turned all this off as
well as she could; sometimes almost
hating herself for having already become
so artful. They thus got to the end of
the first day of Lord Arlingford’s visit
better than she had expected. The father
and son had much to look at, much to
talk over about the place, plantations, &amp;c.
and after the first two days, their party
was enlarged by some young men, friends
of Fitzhenry.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline now found her task comparatively
easy; she was of course the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>object of much attention with all her
new guests; all were anxious to please
her, and to court her acquaintance as
Lord Fitzhenry’s wife; all, too, seemed
surprised at finding Emmeline Benson,
the banker’s daughter, the agreeable,
intelligent, and perfectly well-bred person
which, in truth, she was.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first, timidity made her feel embarrassed
in her new situation; but that
soon wore off, and, naturally gay, her
spirits rose with the gaiety and lively
conversation of those around her. She
could not be indifferent to the flattering
attentions paid her; and, to her own
surprise, Emmeline soon found herself
at her ease, and happy. For Emmeline’s
heart was as yet comparatively free; an
all-engrossing passion had not <i>yet</i> destroyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>its happy tranquillity, and a gay,
joyous laugh often showed the innocent
lightness of that heart. Once, from the
other end of the dinner-table, she found
Lord Fitzhenry’s eyes fixed upon her,
but whether it was surprise at the part
she was able to take in conversation, or
displeasure, perhaps even disgust, at the
gaiety which had thus attracted his attention
towards her, she knew not. But
that look—although his eyes were immediately
withdrawn on meeting hers—had
power instantly to check her mirth; and
her neighbour scarcely recognised in the
absent, silent person that now sat beside
him, the gay companion, who, a
few minutes before, entered so readily
into all his ideas.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline now, nearly for the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>time, heard herself called by her new
name. Her husband, too, forced sometimes
to designate and address her, called
her “Lady Fitzhenry.” To hear oneself
spoken to by a name so dear, that formerly
one hardly dared pronounce it—to
be thus reminded, each time, that we
are indissolubly bound to that being we
adore, is delightful. But in <i>her</i> husband’s
mouth it was to poor Emmeline
an insult. It only seemed to cast her
further from him, and remind her of the
distant footing of mere form on which
they lived, on which they were ever to
live; for “Emmeline,” the name which
when a child she had so often heard him
pronounce, when she cared not for the
endearing intimacy of the appellation,
now never passed his lips.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>She now saw him but little, and never
alone; for he never came into her own
sitting-room, and seldom into the drawing-room,
except at those hours, when he
was certain of finding some of the rest
of the party there also. She felt that
since they had had society in the house,
she had rather lost than gained ground
with him, and she now regretted the
week they had spent tête-à-tête, much
as she had wished it over at the time,
as <i>then</i> they were <i>compelled</i> to have some
sort of intercourse together.</p>

<p class='c014'>Gradually, Emmeline’s abstraction increased,
and her spirits changed; for,
almost unconscious to herself, when in
Fitzhenry’s society, her thoughts and
attention were entirely occupied by him.
The most flattering compliments that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>gallantry could suggest, had sometimes
to be twice repeated to her, and were
at last received with a vacant smile; for
if she caught the distant tone of Fitzhenry’s
voice, she heard nothing else;
and if, during the day, he had more than
usually spoken to her, or paid her some
attention of mere civility, her spirits rose
even beyond their natural level, and thus
gave to her manner at times an appearance
of caprice far from her nature.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>It</span> was now about six weeks since the
fatal day on which Lord and Lady Fitzhenry
were married. His feelings towards
her, to all appearance, remained
the same; but, with Emmeline, the happiness
which depends on insensibility
was gone.</p>
<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Business had hitherto always prevented
Mr. and Mrs. Benson from accepting
the invitation to Arlingford Hall; but
their visit was now fixed to take place
as soon as the present company in the
house were gone. Emmeline respected
her father, and dearly loved her mother;
but still she had by nature so nice a tact,
that she was soon aware that herself, as
well as Lord Fitzhenry, would be better
pleased that they should not fall into a
set and style of society which they could
not suit, and which would not suit them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline rather dreaded her mother’s
visit, dreaded the quick eye of tender
affection, and the gossip of servants.
“But,” thought she, “this visit once
over, I have nothing more to fear; all
will then go on smoothly—smoothly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>sadly to me,” she added. “But I will
hope a time may come when he will care
for me—already I think he is used to my
society; at least, he does not <i>dislike</i> it,
for I am no longer a constraint to him—I
must be patient.” And with a deep-drawn
sigh, she turned over the leaves
of her as yet unopened music-books, and
sat down to practise some of her father’s
favourite songs, which since her marriage
she had neglected; for Fitzhenry had
never asked her to play or sing, and, unsolicited,
she had not had sufficient courage.
Since Lord Arlingford had been with
them they had dined late, and cards and
conversation had filled up the evenings.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length, the day came on which Mr.
and Mrs. Benson were expected. Emmeline’s
heart beat quick the whole of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and her eye was on the road which led
to the house, her ear watching for every
sound all the morning, although it was
impossible they could arrive till late in
the day. Fitzhenry sent his horses to
meet them at the last stage, watched for
their arrival, was at the door of the house
to receive them, helped them out of the
carriage, and himself conducted them up
to Emmeline’s room. There, for a few
minutes, he left them to fold to their
hearts their beloved child. For it was
not a scene that he wished to witness, or
in which he felt, circumstanced as they
were, he had any part to play.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline’s feelings were worked up
to the utmost. Joy, fear, a thousand
confused ideas conspired to weaken her
nerves, and she fell quite overcome into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>her mother’s arms. It was some time
before she could compose herself. But
agitation at that moment was so natural,
that it seemed to cause no astonishment,
nor raise any suspicions.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My own dear Emmeline!” exclaimed
Mrs. Benson, as she kissed her again and
again, “how happy I am to see you once
more, and to see you, as I trust I do,
every way so happy;” and she looked
round with complacency on the refined
comfort of her room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline pressed her mother’s hand,
she could not speak, and with difficulty
forced a smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And how well my lord looks,” said
her father: “the last time I saw him, on
your wedding-day you know, Emmy—Lady
Fitzhenry, I mean; I beg your ladyship’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>pardon,” said he, chuckling, while
making her a formal bow in order to pass
off for wit, what was in fact the real
overflowings of his vanity at her newly-acquired
rank:—”on that day, the nineteenth
of August, eighteen hundred and
twenty-three, I did not like his looks at
all. I really was afraid he was not well;
but I was told it was <i>natural agitation</i>.
Now I can’t for my life conceive why a man
is to look red and yellow and melancholy
on the happiest day of his life. I dare
say I did not when I was married to my
good woman there—Eh, Mrs. B.?—However,
now a wholesome country life, and
true domestic English happiness, you
know, my Lady Fitzhenry, seem to have
made quite another man of him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline tried again to smile.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“It was so good of him,” continued
Mr. Benson, “to press us so often to
come—but it was impossible sooner;
business must be attended to—my old
saying, you know;—and then the kindness
of sending his horses for us, although
I dare say there were plenty to be had
at the inn; but still your old father liked
very much to be brought to Arlingford
Hall in a manner in triumph, driven by
two postilions in the handsome old Fitzhenry
livery, with the coachman on before
to show the way, although I suppose
the drivers knew it quite well; but it did
not signify, I liked all that, egad I did—and
I am not ashamed to own it. And
then, thought I, a man so full of pretty
attentions to his father-in-law, must
make a good husband to my dear girl.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Luckily a kiss of rapture, which he then
imprinted on that dear girl’s face, saved
the necessity of a reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>By this time, Fitzhenry again made
his appearance, apologizing for his absence
under the plea of having had some
orders to give his coachman.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No apology, my lord,” said the excellent
old citizen, seizing his hand,
which he heartily shook; “I consider
myself at home here; you and Emmeline
are one, you know, and it would be
hard indeed if I did not feel at home in
my daughter’s house.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry endeavoured to say something
in return, but failed, and as a
retreat from observation, walked to the
window.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is a dear, good little girl, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>daughter of mine—is she not, my lord?”
continued Mr. Benson, patting Emmeline’s
cheek; “and happiness, and your
good care of her, have given her such a
colour, that I declare I think you must
have already taught her to wear rouge, as
your fine ladies do.” And Mr. Benson
laughed heartily, in gaiety of heart, at
his own wit. Alas! poor Emmeline’s
colour was the flushed crimson of nervous
agitation. Again Fitzhenry had recourse
to looking out of the window at the
horses and carriages, which luckily had
not yet driven off.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ay, they are beautiful animals,” said
Mr. Benson, following him; “bred here
I believe; and then they are so well
matched. I have been admiring them all
the way. Do you ever drive them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>yourself? though <i>now</i> I suppose Emmeline
has taken the reins into her own hands—Eh,
Lady Fitzhenry?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This will never do,” thought Emmeline;
her heart sank within her, and to
put an end to the present trying moment,
she proposed showing her mother her
room; she trusted that her father’s exuberant
spirits would before long vent
themselves, and at any rate, separately,
both she and Fitzhenry could better bear
such attacks. So leaving her father and
husband together, she went out of the
room with Mrs. Benson. The house—her
apartment—the view from the windows—the
attentions of the old housekeeper
who, in a rustling silk gown,
came to make her reverence and offer
her services, all delighted the latter.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>They had much to talk of, aunts, uncles,
cousins to enquire after, and Emmeline’s
spirits became more composed.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length, it was time to dress for
dinner, and Emmeline retired to her
own room. But when there, alone, her
head sank on her hand; and a shiver of
unhappiness—(I write only to those who
have <i>hearts</i>, and to all such these sensations
are but too well known)—the cold
deserted shiver of unhappiness crept over
her frame—”Oh! mine is a hard fate!”
thought she, “to have eternally a part to
act, a secret to conceal, with one, for one,
whose heart is for ever closed to me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The sight of her father and mother had
revived all the affections and associations
of Emmeline’s early youth; and, disappointed
in all her dreams of happiness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the mad, the desperate thought of confessing
her real situation, of leaving Fitzhenry
and Arlingford for ever, and returning
to her parents, crossed her mind.
But a feeling which every day was gaining
ground in her heart, almost unknown
to herself, made her, the next minute,
start with horror at the thought; and,
almost terrified at the idea of the irretrievable
step which in a moment of
hopeless depression she might have been
tempted to take, she resolved that she
would keep her word with her husband,
conceal and bear all, and trust to time
and heaven.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline cooled her burning eyelids,
rang for her maid, and dressed for dinner.
Fitzhenry was perfect in his manner and
attentions to Mr. and Mrs. Benson. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>seemed instinctively to know how to
please the former; sent for the oldest
wine out of the cellar for him, filled his
snuff-box on purpose, bore with his bad
jokes, adapted his conversation to him,
asking him questions—the replies to
which perhaps he never listened to—but
which gave the appearance of seeking
information from him; and, in the
gratitude of her heart for all this kindness,
when she ventured to raise her
eyes on her husband’s handsome, manly
countenance, smiling in goodnature on
her parents, Emmeline wondered how
the idea of leaving him, betraying him,
ever could have entered her mind, and
she thought that to live with so amiable
a being, on any terms, would be happiness.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>As soon as the servants had left the
dining-room, Mr. Benson filled his glass
to a bumper. Emmeline, who observed
the smile on his face as he deliberately
poured in the wine, dreaded what was
coming. “I am an old fashioned old
man,” said Mr. Benson, “and I love all
old customs, so I must beg leave to propose
a toast—My Lord and Lady Fitzhenry,”
said he, bowing to them exultingly,
“and may they, and may I, see
many happy returns of the nineteenth of
August.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline coloured, and fixed her
eyes on the table before her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is the happiest day of my life
I believe,” continued Mr. Benson, “not
even excepting my own wedding-day;
my heart had been so long set on seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>my Emmy happily settled as your wife;
and I must congratulate myself, as well
as you, my Lord, at its having at last
come to pass. For you too have had it
long in your head, or I am much mistaken,”
added Mr. Benson, nodding significantly
to Lord Fitzhenry. “Well
do I remember, when Emmy was not
above so high, your calling her your
little wife, and saying you had a right to
kiss her, when you took leave of us, on
going abroad. I warrant you have not
forgot that any more than myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And in the exuberance of his joy, he
again held out his hand to his son-in-law.
Emmeline dared not look up to see how
her husband stood this trial; her heart
beat so violently that she felt as if its
pulsations must be heard during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>dead silence, which for an instant followed
Mr. Benson’s speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Fitzhenry was the first to break
it; and, hastily drinking off his glass,
as he bowed in return to Mr. Benson,
“You will find this wine very good, I
think,” said he; “it is some which a
friend of mine brought me from Madeira,
and has never been in a wine-merchant’s
hands.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, indeed, most excellent,” replied
Mr. Benson, “and I hope by this
time next year I may drink some of it, to
the health of a little heir to the family.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On poor Emmeline’s cheek, a deadly
paleness so rapidly succeeded the deep
crimson of a minute before, that it caught
even Mr. Benson’s eye, who, although
not quick at observing such dumb indications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of feeling, was sorry to have
distressed her, though he hardly guessed
how he had done so. His spirits were
elevated by the exultation of the moment,
and the “excellent wine” beyond
his usual hilarity—and even beyond his
control.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come, come, Emmy,” said he,
smiling on her—”I meant no offence;
but you know such things often, indeed
I may say commonly do happen, as people
having little boys and little girls
after they are married; and I hope you
may have a little boy some of those days,
that’s all;” and he winked his eye facetiously
at Lord Fitzhenry.</p>

<p class='c014'>The latter however was, as well as
Emmeline, examining the pattern of the
China-plate before him; so that poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Mr. Benson meeting with no encouragement
from any one, was forced to
change the subject of conversation, and
Emmeline soon proposed to her mother
to leave the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Benson took no notice of what
had passed; and Emmeline gradually recovered
herself, although, on the gentlemen
joining them, she found it impossible
to encounter her husband’s
eyes, and, hastily getting up, she went
to the pianoforte. At first, her hand
trembled, but a feeling of pride steadied
it; and on her father asking for one
of his old favourite songs, she complied.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry gradually approached her,
and when she had finished singing—”That
is very beautiful,” said he, “You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>have never before indulged me with any
music.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!” replied Mr. Benson, “that is
a great shame, when I paid I don’t know
what to a Signor——what do you call
him? for teaching her. She can sing
you any of your fine bravuras; but a
plain English song, for my money; it is
worth all your Italian airs, for there is
some sense, some meaning in that, but,
as for your foreign nonsense, one can’t
understand what the words are about;
no one can make head or tail of them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline could not help smiling; and,
looking up, her eyes met Fitzhenry’s.
He too smiled, and smiled so kindly on
her that, for an instant, she fancied
there was affection, even fondness in
their expression.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Perhaps,” said he, “you will nevertheless
indulge me with one of the unmeaning
songs Mr. Benson complains
of.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline sang one of Rossini’s. Fitzhenry
sat down by the pianoforte opposite
to her, his head leaning on his
hand; and, at first, he looked attentively
at her, but when the song was over, he
seemed so lost in thought as to have totally
forgot the singer. He said nothing;
suffered her to leave the instrument
without making any attempt at
detaining her, and soon after left the
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>On his return, he proposed a game at
whist; Emmeline had early learnt it to
make up her father’s party, so a card-table
was rung for. Of course, Mr. and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Mrs. Benson were to play together, and
many cruel things were said about not
parting husband and wife, &amp;c. But
Fitzhenry’s behaviour that evening had
been to Emmeline (in spite of his disregard
of the song he had asked for) an
additional draft of love, and she bore all
most bravely, for she felt it was for him
she was bearing it; she did not venture
to observe him while all this was passing,
but by the tone of his voice, he
seemed to endure these trials with patience
and unruffled temper.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Benson and his wife won every
game, for their adversaries knew little
of what was going on, trumping and
taking each other’s tricks with the most
perfect mutual indifference. But Mr.
Benson only exulted in his superior play,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>as chuckling, he put his daughter’s
money into his pocket, and he retired to
bed in high good humour.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning, after breakfast,
Fitzhenry took Mr. Benson to show him
the farm, stables, &amp;c. and Emmeline and
her mother were left together. Mrs.
Benson for some time fidgetted about the
room, giving dry laconic answers to all
Emmeline’s observations, which she knew
well, was a symptom of her working herself
up to say something unusual, and she
dreaded what it might be. At length,
Mrs. Benson came up to her daughter,
and folding her to her heart, as she
printed a fond kiss on her forehead——”Well,
my dear child,” she said, “I
trust I see you as happy as heart—as
even my foolish heart can wish?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“How can you doubt it?” answered
Emmeline, greatly embarrassed by so
direct a question. “You see how kind,
how excellent he is”—and to avoid her
mother’s anxious gaze, she stooped down
to caress an old poodle of Fitzhenry’s
that had lately established himself in
her room. “Speak, Tiber,” said she to
the dog—”Have we not a most kind
master?”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a pause, but Mrs. Benson
returned to the charge.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I find you live quite <i>fashionably</i>, in
separate apartments. I must say I think
that is a silly new fangled, refinement
which I don’t approve of at all, and I
hope it is no fancy of yours?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline coloured deeply.—”Lord
Fitzhenry,” she replied, “had so long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>lived abroad, was so used to foreign customs,
that she did not wonder he liked
to adopt them at home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Lord Fitzhenry was not a married
man abroad, I presume?” said Mrs.
Benson, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline forced one too, but her lip
quivered, tears came into her eyes, and
again she was obliged to stoop and coax
the dog.</p>

<p class='c014'>“By the bye, Emmeline,” said Mrs.
Benson, after a moment’s silence, “I
have brought you your work-box which
you left in Harley-street; I wonder you
did not miss it, for I suppose you have
a good deal of time to yourself now,
and are more alone than you used to be
with us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All women must be a good deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>alone when they leave home,” replied
Emmeline, with as steady a voice as she
could command,—”for the occupations
and amusements of men are so different,
particularly in the country.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you <i>are</i> chiefly by yourself,”
said Mrs. Benson, hastily, as if catching
at the confession, as something she was
seeking for.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear no, I go out riding with
some of the gentlemen nearly every day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you do, do you?” said Mrs.
Benson; “and Lord Fitzhenry, does he
go too?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, generally.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thought he had not,” said Mrs.
Benson rather vacantly, and appearing
to be engaged in some ruminations of her
own.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Emmeline took advantage of the momentary
pause that followed, to start
a new subject of conversation. She
trusted, that when her mother saw how
perfectly good humoured and indulgent
Lord Fitzhenry was to her; in all things
allowing her to be her own mistress, as
well as mistress of his house, that the
doubts and suspicions which she saw
had been raised in her mind, either by
her own observations, or her maid’s gossipping
reports, would subside. For, as
Emmeline suspected, this conversation
had, in fact, been brought on by some
stories which Mrs. Benson had already
heard. Her maid and Emmeline’s were
old acquaintance; and what maid or mistress
can help talking over her neighbour’s
affairs? The truth was, that Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Brown, the old housekeeper, and Susan,
Emmeline’s maid, (now promoted to
Mrs. Jenkins,) had already quarrelled;
for the latter soon began to throw
out hints, which Mrs. Brown, thinking
herself bound to stand up for
her master, resented violently; so that
by the time Mrs. Benson arrived,
Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Brown were
open enemies; and the former lost no
time in securing on her side her
old companion Warren—Mrs. Benson’s
maid.</p>

<p class='c014'>As soon, therefore, as they had swallowed
their tea, at which solemn and
important ceremony Mrs. Brown had
presided in all the pomp of housekeeper
civility, the two friends retired; and
while Mrs. Benson’s clothes were arranged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>in the drawers by the maid, Jenkins,
with many a sigh over poor Miss
Emmeline, and many an exaggeration,
gave an account of the <i>dreadful</i>
way in which Lord and Lady Fitzhenry
lived together, and of my Lord’s shameful
neglect of her. “In short,” she
ended with saying, “things are come to
such a pitch, that Mrs. Brown and I are
scarce on speaking terms, and I am, as
you see, very distant even with Mr.
Reynolds. People must see what they
does see, except those people who wo’nt
see, and I am quite resolved on one
thing—which is, to be as uppish as possible
both with Mrs. Brown and Mr.
Reynolds till I see my lord behave better
to my lady. I am but a servant,
certainly; but I can’t for all that, help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>thinking it a very strange thing the way
they go on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what does Mrs. Brown say to
this?” enquired her auditor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh she says, forsooth, that it is all
my vulgar notions, and because I have
not been used to quality.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quality, indeed!” echoed her
friend. “Fine airs, upon my word.
Miss Emmeline was as good as Lord
Fitzhenry any day in the year, I am
sure. I should like to know who had
the most money, and the best of the
bargain? Poor thing! she is much
changed; and when she said to me,
‘How do you do, Warren?’ I could
plainly see that all was not right between
her and Lord Fitzhenry. You know <i>I</i>
was always against the match.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>The conversation was here interrupted
by the entrance of Mrs. Brown, who
came to enquire whether any thing was
wanted in the rooms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing ma’am, thank you,” said
Warren dryly, endeavouring to throw
into her manner that dignity which Jenkins
said she was determined to keep up
till Lord Fitzhenry was a better husband,
and which Warren, as her sworn ally,
thought it right to adopt also. And
then pretending to be busily occupied,
she took no notice of Mrs. Brown.
Warren’s behaviour was so different from
what it had been when they had parted
at the tea table, that the consequential
housekeeper guessed directly to whose
influence the change was owing. She
said nothing; but settling the shawl that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>was pinned on her shoulders, and casting
an angry glance at Jenkins, she
bustled out of the room, saying, she
would send the <i>housemaid</i> to attend upon
them; and resolving to be revenged on
the two friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have affronted Mrs. Brown
finely,” said Jenkins, as soon as she
had, with somewhat of a jirk, closed the
door after her; “but I am glad of it, for
really that is the only way to mend matters,
and I feel it my duty to my lady,
to quarrel in a manner with Mrs. Brown,
though, as far as I am myself concerned,
I am, as you know, the most good
naturedest of people, and willing to
live in peace and harmony with every
one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That you are,” replied Mrs. Warren;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>for, at that moment, she thought it
good policy to forget, as well as Mrs
Jenkins did, the many regular pitched
battles they had fought, when the latter
was simple Susan, and nominally under
Warren’s controul.</p>

<p class='c014'>The result of this conversation was a
mysterious and sorrowful expression on
Warren’s countenance when she attended
her lady, Mrs. Benson, at bed-time;
and a significantly melancholy
tone of voice when she said, “I hope
you find Lady Fitzhenry pretty well,
ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quite well,” said Mrs. Benson.
“She has not been ill that I know of.
Susan does not say she has been unwell,
does she?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no; Mrs. Jenkins says her ladyship’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>health is wonderfully good, considering,”
replied Warren.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Considering <i>what</i>?” said Mrs. Benson,
turning quickly round, and looking
her in the face, “What do you mean by
<i>considering</i>?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>I</i> mean? dear me, how should <i>I</i>
mean any thing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, you speak as if you <i>did</i> mean
something; and I desire if you know any
thing about Emmeline’s health, that you
will tell me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“La, ma’am! there is nothing the
matter with Miss Emmeline as I know
of, only I thought perhaps she might
not be so lively-like as she used to be,
living so much alone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you mean by alone? I
suppose Lord and Lady Fitzhenry are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>as much together as other married people
are? I don’t expect he sits all day
at home with her, any more than Mr.
Benson does with me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe you will find it is very
different from you and my master,” said
Warren, with a significant sigh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What <i>can</i> you mean by all this?”
said Mrs. Benson, alarmed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, I mean, ma’am, that Miss
Emmeline, (Lady Fitzhenry, that is to
say,) is always alone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Always alone?” repeated Mrs. Benson;
“really Warren I don’t know what
you would be at—and I don’t believe
<i>you</i> know yourself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, ma’am,” said Warren, bridling
up; “and I only say what I know to be
true. Lord Fitzhenry sleeps in his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>room alone all night, and Lady Fitzhenry
sits in her room alone all day; and, if
that is living like a married pair, I don’t
know what a married pair is.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who tells you all this nonsense?”
said Mrs. Benson, angrily, and yet wishing
to hear more.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, Mrs. Jenkins, to be sure,
ma’am. She says, that my lord quarrelled
with my lady on their very wedding-day—for
that she herself heard
high words between them and doors
shut in a passion-like—and ever since
that terrible scene—which Jenkins can
swear to—they have continued to live
in this strange way. For my part, I don’t
think if I was Mrs. Jenkins I would remain
in so unpleasant a family, although
to be sure all is in very high style, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the housekeeper’s room as good as many
ladies’ drawing-rooms, with a nice Turkey
carpet; but still all can’t be right. However,
I should be sorry to tell tales and
make mischief; but you know, ma’am,
you forced me to speak, otherwise I am
sure I should have held my tongue about
it all to my dying day, for I am sure I
would not for all the world make you
uneasy, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I desire you will hold your
tongue to every body else,” said Mrs.
Benson gravely, “and bid Susan come
to me to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Susan told her story, heightening the
picture as much as she could; and, after
all this, it will not be wondered at that
Mrs. Benson endeavoured to discover
the truth from Emmeline. Her answers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>her praises of Fitzhenry, staggered her;
and, as Emmeline had anticipated, the
appearance of perfect good humour on
the part of her husband, often even of
gallant attention towards her, made
Mrs. Benson think the whole was no
more than the common gossip of servants;
and, at any rate, she had too
much good sense to endeavour to pry
into matrimonial secrets and arrangements,
which her daughter did not seem
to wish to have noticed; so, resolving
to be very watchful, she said no more.</p>

<p class='c014'>A day or two after, several of the
neighbours, who had been invited, came
to Arlingford. Mr. and Mrs. Benson
were of course delighted on seeing the
deference and court paid to their daughter;
and the bustle occasioned by the visitors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the driving about in the morning,
viewing the country, and returning visits,
occupied Mrs. Benson’s time, if not her
thoughts, so entirely, that she and
Emmeline being seldom alone together,
the latter was spared any more distressing
conversations.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the end of about a week, Mr. Benson
received letters which obliged him
to return immediately to town on some
mercantile business. “But,” said he,
casting a doubtful, enquiring look on Lord
Fitzhenry, “I need not carry off my
good lady wife, if you will give her
house-room a little longer, and I can
perhaps return for her; or, at any rate,
I think I may by this time trust her to
travel alone, whatever other husbands
may”—winking his eye at Emmeline.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Lord Fitzhenry directly expressed
great pleasure in Mrs. Benson prolonging
her visit, and then, after a moment’s
pause, added, “Indeed it will be particularly
kind to Lady Fitzhenry if she
will, for I myself shall be obliged to leave
home in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline gave a start, and involuntarily
looked up towards her husband.
For an instant their eyes met; but, as if
by mutual consent, both were instantly
withdrawn. “He catches at the first
opportunity to leave me,” thought she.
“Glad his penance is over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Whither he was going, Fitzhenry never
said, and Emmeline dared not ask; indeed,
she hardly knew whether, during
his absence, he would expect her to write
to him; and therefore, if even under that
pretext she could venture to enquire.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>On the day settled for his departure,
when the carriage was ready at the
door, he came into the drawing-room to
take leave. Mrs. Benson was there with
Emmeline.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If there come any letters for me,”
said he, “I have desired Reynolds to
send them to the house in town, and
I shall leave word there to have them
forwarded.” Still he said nothing about
her writing to him. He staid some time
in the room, seemingly uncertain what
to do or say, or how to take leave of
her. At length, apparently summoning
courage for a disagreeable effort, he
walked hastily up to Mrs. Benson,
shook hands with her, came up to Emmeline
and did the same, adding, in
rather a low voice, “I shall be glad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to hear from you;” and, not waiting
for any answer, he hurried out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the first time their hands had
ever met since that morning after their
marriage, when she had herself offered
hers to Fitzhenry in token of forgiveness
and goodwill. Since then, now nearly
two months past, her sentiments towards him
had taken a totally different character;
her face blushed crimson; but he, whose
slightest touch had thus thrilled to her
heart, and had power to raise that
blush, almost before the “eloquent
blood” had reached her cheek, was
already gone.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the window she sadly saw him
drive off; whither and to whom he was
going, she could not doubt.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Several days passed, and she heard
nothing from him; at last, a letter,
franked Fitzhenry, was put into her
hands; she opened it hastily—her heart
beating with emotion—but it merely
enclosed a printed one from some trades-person
in London, applying for her custom.
In a fit of vexation, almost of
anger, she was nearly throwing the whole
into the fire, when some writing on one
of the flaps of the cover caught her
attention, and she found these words.</p>

<div class='lh c011'>

<p class='c015'>“The longer Mrs. Benson can stay
with you the better; I believe I shall
not be home for a fortnight. Should she
not be able to remain, perhaps you had
better go and pay your father a visit;
and I will let you know when I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>likely to be at Arlingford again; but
now, and always, do whatever you yourself
like best. I hope soon to hear you
are well.</p>
<p class='c020'>“Yours,<br />
“<span class='sc'>Fitzhenry</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>“So you have got a letter from your
husband,” said Mrs. Benson; “and a
fine thick packet. I hope he is well?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quite well,” said Emmeline, sadly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What news does he give? what has
he been about?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“News?” repeated Emmeline, absently—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes; I mean—what does he say?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Say? oh, nothing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What! nothing in all that quantity
of paper and writing? Lord, child!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>you are quite in a dream”—and Mrs.
Benson took off her spectacles, and her
eyes from the newspaper she was reading,
and fixed them attentively on her
daughter. This roused her from her
reverie, and suddenly recollecting herself,
she said, “Oh yes, I forget; he
says, he can’t come home yet, and we
had better go to Charlton to my father
till his return.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I think that will be a very
good plan,” said Mrs. Benson: “some
business, I suppose, detains him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose so,” echoed Emmeline.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Benson still kept her eyes fixed
on Emmeline, and both remained for
some time in silence and abstraction.
Again all her former doubts and suspicions
returned to her mind; and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>she looked on her absent, dejected
daughter, who still sat gazing on the letter
in her hand, she almost resolved to
speak to her, and force herself into her
confidence. But though with little of the
outward refinement of the world, Mrs.
Benson had great delicacy of feeling, as
well as excellent sense: she felt that when
she was not called upon to give advice, or
to reprehend what was wrong, she had no
business to interfere between her daughter
and her husband; and indeed, here,
what could she say? Emmeline was certainly
changed; she was no longer the
gay, light-hearted being she used to be,
but <i>apparently</i> her husband behaved perfectly
well to her; at least nothing had
ever passed, that Mrs. Benson could have
named as a proof of unkindness; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>as for Emmeline, she was to him gentleness—acquiescence
itself; but still,
Mrs. Benson could not help feeling
that all was not right, although she
could not perhaps have given any positive
reason for her suspicions. How
she longed to bid her confide to her
every feeling, every care of her heart,
as in days of yore, when she hushed
her young sorrows to rest on her bosom,
and kissed away her childish tears!
But when a mother resigns her darling
child to him who is to be the arbiter
of her future destiny, she loses, in a great
measure, that dear prerogative of affection.
Mrs. Benson, feeling this, wisely
forbore; and the next day, without any
thing more passing between them on
the subject, they set off together for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Charlton, where Mr. Benson had, since
Lady Fitzhenry’s marriage, chiefly resided.</p>

<p class='c014'>When there, Emmeline wrote to her
husband. There is something so private,
so sacred, in a letter—we can, in writing,
express so much, which, either from
shyness, or emotion, we cannot bring
ourselves to say by word of mouth, that
Emmeline longed to give way to her
inclinations, and pour out on the paper
her feelings towards him; but she felt
that the utterance of one word which
could in any way be interpreted into an
allusion to her painful situation, would
be breaking her agreement; and she
merely told him of her journey and her
safe arrival; glad of having even such
uninteresting subjects to treat of, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>that to Fitzhenry! to whom she <i>could</i>
have written volumes!</p>

<p class='c014'>In about ten days she got an answer;
it had no date: (his letters to her never
had beyond the post town on the frank.)
In it, he named the day for his return to
Arlingford. Two days previous to it,
notwithstanding Mrs. Benson’s remonstrances,
and her father’s railleries, Emmeline
would return home. “He might
possibly arrive,” she thought to herself;
“something might bring him back before
the day he had fixed upon, and she
was resolved on departure.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But, exactly the contrary happened
from what she had anticipated; that day
passed in anxious but vain expectation;
and the next—and the next. At length,
on the fourth, Reynolds, with a countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>expressive of the share he had
taken in the disappointment, put a letter
into her hand, with the well-known,
well-beloved signature of Fitzhenry.
And it did not, this time, merely enclose
a printed petition, but was from himself.
He said in it, that the unexpected arrival
of his friend Mr. Pelham, (the
minister at Vienna,) had detained him
in town, as he had waited till he could
accompany him to Arlingford, which he
now hoped he should be able to do in
a couple of days. Mr. Moore, his former
travelling companion, would also
come with him, and they would soon be
followed by his cousin, Lady Saville,
her husband, and sister. Emmeline had
just seen Lady Saville, when she had
paid a visit of form to the Benson family,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>on the match being declared; and on the
wedding-day she was present at the
ceremony.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Two</span> tedious solitary days were still to
be passed before Emmeline expected
Fitzhenry at Arlingford. Being secure
that she had the house all to herself
she felt a strong inclination to go into
his room, which she had never yet entered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>It would be, she thought, the
next best thing to seeing himself.
Treading softly, as if fearful he might
hear her, she put her hand on the lock—looked
round to see if she was observed,
and then hastily turned it. The door was
locked.</p>
<p class='c014'>The noise she made brought a housemaid
out of an adjoining room.—”The
door is locked my lady: when my lord
went away, he desired the housekeeper
to keep the key, but I will step to Mrs.
Brown and fetch it, if your ladyship
wants any thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no, it is of no consequence,”
said Emmeline, colouring deeply, as if
detected in some crime.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline was the most single-hearted
of beings. She had not sufficient presence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of mind to think of any excuse
for wishing to go into her husband’s
room; and with a feeling of awkwardness,
almost of shame, she returned to
her own. Disappointed, and dispirited,
she knew not what to turn to; and for
the first time in her life, felt it impossible
to occupy herself; the day appeared
endless, and her time, an insupportable
weight. As she wandered about her
own room, her eyes fell on a petition
she had had from a poor man residing
on the estate, whose house and mill had
been nearly destroyed by fire. He lived
a few miles off, and Emmeline determined
to enquire of Reynolds about him,
and, glad to have found an object, to ride
to his abode in order to see what could
be done for the family—rather ashamed
of herself for having allowed her mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>to be so entirely engrossed by one subject,
that she had totally forgotten this
petition which she had received while at
Charlton.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline went into the dining-room
and summoned Reynolds. In this room
hung a picture of Fitzhenry, painted at
the time of his leaving school, when a
boy about sixteen. It was much less
handsome than he now was; his character
was not then, as now, marked on
his countenance, giving it that look of
manly openness, and yet of feeling, for
which it was so remarkable; but, (as
the eyes looking out of the picture seemed
to smile on the beholder,) it was so agreeable
to Emmeline to gaze on it, that,
lost in thought, she forgot entirely what
brought her there. How long she had
remained, she knew not, but on turning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>round she saw Reynolds in the room
quietly waiting her orders.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you ring, my lady,” said the
old man, with a benevolent smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes,” said Emmeline, rather
embarrassed. “But at this moment I
have forgotten——.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, many a time have I forgot myself
looking at that picture,” answered
Reynolds. “It was considered an excellent
likeness when it was done; it
was just when we left Eton.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, were you there with Lord
Fitzhenry?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes!” my lady, I have been
with my Lord ever since he was seven
years old; Lord Arlingford did not like
to have nursery-maids about him, so I
had entire the charge of him—went with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>him to school, to Oxford, and then
abroad; so no wonder I love him, I may
say as my son. I hope no offence,”
added he, tears starting into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, you were abroad with him?”
said Emmeline, hastily catching at the
word; <i>why</i> she did not know, except
that it seemed always as if that word
contained the history of her husband’s
life and affections.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, my lady, I was in Italy and
at Vienna with him. I was three years
abroad, and then, when he returned
again to Italy ... (he paused)—I
felt I was too old to begin again; I
thought some younger servant would
suit my lord better, and I begged leave
to come home; and though certainly it
was not my place, yet I tried hard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>persuade my lord to come home too; for
I own I thought little good would come
of living so much out of one’s own
country—people get a love for rambling,
never can settle, and learn bad foreign
ways——.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And again he stopped short, as if he
feared he might already have said too
much. Emmeline longed to hear more,
and yet she also thought perhaps she had
allowed him to go too far; and making
no comment on what he had said, she
hastily ejaculated—”Oh! I remember
now what I rang for. I want to know
where that man of the name of Rawlins
now lives, who wrote me this petition,
and if you know any thing about him,
and what can be done for him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Rawlins whose mill was burnt?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Oh yes! my lady, I know him very
well, but all that is settled. My lord, to
whom he also applied, wrote to me to
find him employment, and to give him
and his family, for the present, a cottage
that chanced to be vacant, and he also
desired me to give the wife some allowance
weekly till they had a little recovered
themselves, and till he could see
what more could be done for them, for
they are honest industrious people, and
my lord is so good. I have his letter
somewhere about me, if your ladyship
would like to see it,” added Reynolds,
searching in a large pocket-book, in
which among heaps of bills and papers
he at last found it, and gave it to Emmeline.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her heart overflowed towards her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>husband. “How good! how kind he
is!” thought she, and she almost added,
“kind to every one but me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The letter said nothing more than
what Reynolds had repeated; but still,
even to see his hand-writing was agreeable.
She was just going to return it
to him, when on the other side of the
page, a postscript and her own name
caught her eye, and with a beating
heart, she continued:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope you have attended to those
alterations in the greenhouse which
Lady Fitzhenry wished to have made—and
desire the groom to exercise her
horse properly for her before her return,
for when I last rode him he was much
too spirited.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline read and re-read these few
words expressive of care and thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>for her, till she exaggerated their meaning
far beyond their original import, and
on them built many a visionary castle
of future happiness. She mounted her
horse, and many an additional caress
and kind word she addressed to the animal,
now that it was connected in her
mind with Fitzhenry, and with the first
expression of interest about herself that
had ever escaped him. She found the
Rawlins family overflowing with gratitude,
and offering up prayers for her
husband, in which it cannot be doubted
she most heartily joined.</p>

<p class='c014'>Buoyed up by all these exhilarating
feelings, she had almost forgotten her real
situation, and the terms on which she and
this beloved Fitzhenry lived; and in
these flattering dreams, the two intervening
days quickly passed, and that on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>which she was to expect him at last arrived.
The whole of the morning was
spent in restless anticipations of happiness,
picturing to herself their meeting,
fancying what he would say to her, how
he would look at her, till she actually
heard his carriage drive up to the door.
With a beating heart she flew to the
window, and her delighted eye caught
the first glance of the face she loved.</p>

<p class='c014'>His two friends were with him, and
all three entered the room together.
Emmeline was so overjoyed at seeing
him again after a month’s separation—(a
century in love’s calculation of time,)
that fearful of expressing too much, she
remained as if spell-bound in her place.
Fitzhenry came up to her, but his manner
was, if possible, more cold, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>embarrassed than ever. How unlike
the meeting that she had indulged herself
in acting over and over in her own
mind! He introduced his two companions
to her. Mr. Pelham had one of
those calm but expressive countenances
which directly obtains our interest; and
when he held out his hand to Emmeline,
claiming the friendship of his
friend’s wife, the interest seemed reciprocal.
Indeed, his look of anxious
curiosity when presented to her, would
have been embarrassing, had not his
manner been marked with a peculiar
appearance of kindness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Very different was the impression
made on Emmeline by Mr. Moore. Although
he looked clever and lively, she
shrunk at once from him; the glance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>his eye had something penetrating and
satirical which she dreaded. With a
pure guileless heart, and an unreproving
conscience, poor Emmeline could not
help fearing a quick observer of feelings
in all the little daily occurrences
of life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rest of the party that Fitzhenry
had announced followed the day after.
Lady Saville was what might be called
agreeable in society, although more from
possessing the polish and easy manner
of the world, than from any decided
talents or accomplishments. At first,
she and her sister had, with the true impertinence
of fine ladies, settled between
them, that Emmeline could only
be fit to laugh at; and they anticipated
no little amusement in quizzing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>banker’s daughter. But when they
found her, as even they were themselves
obliged to allow, quite on a
par with themselves, perfect in manners,
and in fact possessing the outward
good breeding of the world, although
free from that falsehood and selfishness
which so often destroys its charm, they
changed their tone, and resolved they
would patronize her, declaring, “she
was quite a person to be brought forward.”
And they soon, found real
pleasure in her society and conversation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some of the county neighbours, with
whom Lady Saville was previously acquainted,
joined the party, and the
house was quite full. This, Emmeline
plainly saw was now Fitzhenry’s plan of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>life when forced to be at Arlingford;
and she was compelled with a sigh to
own it was the best for them both; for
in so numerous a society of course they
were necessarily apart, and any coldness
was little remarked. She could
not help being aware that the distance
between them, and the awkwardness of
their manner, had rather encreased than
worn off. And could it be otherwise?
Two people no way connected can live
under the same roof mutually cold and
careless, and still be perfectly good
friends, for the one will think so little
about the other, that, when thrown together
by chance, their manners will
wear the ease of indifference. But between
Fitzhenry and Emmeline, this
was impossible. Both entirely engrossed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>by one feeling, which was to be
concealed from the other, they had no
<i>point de reunion</i>, no neutral ground on
which to meet; and the more poor Emmeline’s
affections became engaged, the
more—and she felt conscious of it herself—the
more timid and cold her
manner grew towards her husband, and
that of course reacted on Fitzhenry’s.
He evidently too was now much out of
spirits, and looked ill. Mr. Moore’s
gaiety seemed too much for him; he rallied
him too much on his gravity, and on
his lately acquired married importance,
as he called it, appearing to Emmeline
purposely to take pleasure in tormenting
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Pelham seemed the friend he preferred,
and yet, after their being long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>together, Fitzhenry always appeared
more than usually abstracted and dejected.
Mr. Pelham too was the person
who seemed to pay the most attention,
and to take the greatest interest in herself.
She fancied, indeed, that he
watched them both; but it was always
with such a kind, compassionate, benignant
look, that she did not, as with
Mr. Moore, shrink from his scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c014'>The winter was now far advanced;
hunting and shooting kept the gentlemen
almost entirely out of doors, and Emmeline
and her female companions were
generally all the morning left to themselves.
One rainy day, on which it was
impossible for them to leave the house,
and when Lady Saville had run through
or yawned over every novel and review
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>in the drawing-room, she proposed, for
the sake of exercise, to go all over the
house. “I have never yet even been
admitted into your sanctum sanctorum,
Lady Fitzhenry, pray let me go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! pray do,” echoed a young lady,
starting up from a table at which she had
been seated the whole morning, with
most laudable industry engaged in working
a purse, and endeavouring to make
a hearts-ease out of invisible blue and
yellow beads. “Do let us go; it will get
us through this dull morning so nicely;
and really without Mr. Moore and the
battledoor and shuttlecock, one don’t
know what to do with oneself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline, always wishing to be
obliging, led the way to her apartment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How comfortable! how pretty!” all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>exclaimed. “Did you fit up this room
yourself?” enquired Lady Saville. Emmeline
answered, that she found it as it
was when she first came to Arlingford.
“What a delightful, gallant husband!”
said Lady Saville. “Now that was his
foreign education; all men should be
sent abroad before they marry, to be
properly drilled; it improves them wonderfully.”
Poor Emmeline could not
quite assent to this observation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! dear, dear Lady Fitzhenry!”
said the purse-making young lady, (by
name Miss Selina Danvers,) flying up
to her and seizing her hand with ecstatic
fondness, “I have the greatest possible
favour to ask of you; pray, pray
grant it—it is to let me see your wedding-dress;
I shall be more obliged to
you than I can express.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“There is nothing remarkable to see,”
said Emmeline, coldly, not feeling the
smallest wish to behold, or have discussed,
what brought back so painfully
to her mind the day on which she
wore it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is really being very modest,”
said Lady Saville, “for it was beautiful,
and, moreover, you looked remarkably
pretty in it; and I own I was rather provoked
at my worthy cousin Fitzhenry’s
excessive stupidity or bashfulness, for I
don’t think he ever looked at you. I
never saw a man appear so completely
stupified, and put out as he was at his
marriage; and when I wished him joy,
he stared, and looked as silly and sheepish
as possible. Love certainly had upon
him the direct contrary effect from what
it had on Cymon.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Dear, how odd!” exclaimed Miss
Danvers. “But who is Mr. Cymon, and
what did it do to him? Now don’t laugh
at me so, one can’t know every body;
and I don’t go every year to London as
you do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This new scent about Cymon, however,
could not put the wedding finery out of
Selina’s head, and she teazed poor Emmeline
till she obtained from her a reluctant
consent that her maid and the
gown should be rung for; and soon the
whole paraphernalia was exhibited with
pride and pomp by Mrs. Jenkins.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Selina went into ecstasies at each
separate flower and flounce, and putting
the veil over her head, she flew to the
glass to look at herself. “What a beauty
it is!” she exclaimed. “Dear, how I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>should like to be married! one looks so
interesting in a lace gown and veil.
Lady Fitzhenry, were you very much
frightened at the ceremony? did you
cry? For my part, I don’t think I should
be able to keep my countenance for
laughing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“At what?” demanded Lady Saville.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I don’t know at what, in particular;
but I think it would be so odd for
me to be married.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should it be more odd to you
than any one else?” rejoined Lady Saville.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I can’t tell, only because I think
it would be so droll—but I should like
it of all things—and then the new chaise-and-four,
and the favours, and driving
off in such a bustle, and all the people
in the street staring at one; and one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>wedding-ring, and one’s new name; it
would all be so charming. If I was you,
Lady Fitzhenry, I think I should have
rung the bell the minute I was married,
to have had the pleasure of hearing the
servant say, ‘Yes, <i>my Lady</i>.’ Oh! I have
another great favour to ask,” continued
Miss Selina, who had by this time satisfied
her curiosity about the gown and
veil; “do let me see your picture of
Lord Fitzhenry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline assured her she had none
to show her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No? Dear, how odd! I thought when
people were married, they had always
their picture painted in miniature as a
thing of course, and I had even settled
beforehand how <i>ours</i> should be done—I
all in clouds and thin drapery by Mrs.
Mee, you know, and he in armour.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“And who is the <i>he</i> whose costume
you have already fixed upon?” enquired
Lady Saville.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I don’t know; whoever I may
chance to marry. But, Lady Fitzhenry,
how did it happen that you had no miniatures
done? for yours was a regular marriage,
was it not? Every body delighted,
and jewels and plate, and all that sort of
thing; and then Lord Fitzhenry is so
handsome. Lady Saville, don’t you think
Lord Fitzhenry is the most beautiful man
you ever saw, and the most agreeable?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why I don’t know how far I may
venture to answer that question. What
would Sir George say?” replied Lady
Saville, laughing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! Sir George is very tall and good
looking too, and dresses himself very
well; but still he does not put on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>neckcloth near so well as Lord Fitzhenry;
and after all, the neckcloth is the
principal thing in a man, and Lady Fitzhenry
is certainly the most fortunate of
people; but she takes her good luck
very quietly, I must say—not even to
have talked of her wedding gown! was
it not strange?”</p>

<p class='c014'>By this time every thing was thoroughly
admired, examined, and descanted
upon in Emmeline’s room, and
many a question put to her, which she
found rather difficult to answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, where do we proceed to next?”
said Lady Saville, going out into the gallery.
“What room is this?” pointing to
Ernest’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! that is Lord Fitzhenry’s,” answered
Emmeline hastily; “we had better
not go there.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“Why not?” enquired Lady Saville.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He may be engaged with business,”
replied Emmeline, conscious she was colouring.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Engaged? why you know he is out
hunting twenty miles off; but at any
rate, we may knock and demand admission.”
And she knocked at the door.
No sound was to be heard, and she turned
the lock. “Why I really believe, Lady
Fitzhenry,” continued she, “you are
afraid of going in, for fear of finding all
my worthy cousin’s former <i>cheres amies</i>
hanging round the room on pegs, like
Blue-beard’s wives.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this sally, Miss Danvers laughed
violently. “I am dying to go in.—Dear
Lady Saville, pray, pray open the door;
I am sure we shall find something odd.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline could think of no further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>reason to give for not entering; and, in
truth, felt rather glad of the opportunity
so forced upon her to visit that room
where Fitzhenry had passed and still
passed so many hours of his life. A person’s
apartment is certainly the next best
thing to their society, and even ranks in
the gratification of our feelings before a
letter; we seem to be admitted into all
their occupations, even into their very
thoughts. Then the little things belonging
to them scattered about identify them so
much to us. Every one must have experienced
this when going into the room
that has been inhabited by some dear
friend immediately after their departure;
the pens they have used still lying
wet on the table, the books they had
been reading—a glove, or handkerchief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>forgotten. How strongly do such trifles
sometimes affect us, and give us a deceitful
feeling of their presence!</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Saville had opened the door into
Fitzhenry’s room, and Emmeline had
gone in with the rest, when luckily,
after Miss Selina had expressed her
astonishment at Lord Fitzhenry’s sleeping
in the little couch bed, and had enquired
of Lady Saville whether it was
not very droll—a book of French caricatures
attracted and fixed the attention of
the whole party, and Emmeline was thus
left at liberty to look at every thing in the
room, and indulge in her own reflections.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>There</i> was the table at which he
wrote, the chair on which he sat, and
she placed herself in it. On the table,
among a confusion of parliamentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>papers, pamphlets, bills, &amp;c. was a volume
of Petrarch, lying open, as if
lately read, and by it the cover of a
letter recently torn open. It was directed
to Fitzhenry, and in a woman’s
hand. On the seal, were the words—“<i>Tout
ou rien</i>”—words that said volumes
to poor Emmeline’s heart. She
tried to make out the post-mark, but it
was so blotted over that she could only
decypher the date, which convinced her
it had been that very day received!
With a sort of shudder she threw it
down again, and, getting up from her
seat, her eye was attracted by two
drawings that hung over the chimney-piece—they
were evidently views in
Italy and Greece. In both these, were
the same two figures: below one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the drawings, these lines from Lord
Byron were written:—</p>

<div class='lh c011'>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sweet Florence! those were pleasant times</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When worlds were staked for ladies eyes.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Had bards as many realms as rhymes,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thy charms might raise new Anthonies.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though fate forbids such things to be,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yet, by thine eyes and ringlets curled,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I cannot lose a world for thee,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But would not lose thee for a world.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c013'>Beneath the other drawing, was a
Greek inscription. They were slight
sketches, and the figures were small;
one of them had an air of Fitzhenry
not to be mistaken by her who knew
his every look and gesture. The other
was a female figure. Emmeline’s eyes
were rivetted on the drawings; she could
not doubt who, and what they represented;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>some days of peculiar enjoyment,
some tender moments were thus
recalled, and poor Emmeline’s spirit
groaned within her.</p>
<p class='c014'>On the mantle-piece, lay Fitzhenry’s
pencil-case, pocket-book, and several of
those sort of trifles that seem so intimately
connected with the person to
whom they belong. Emmeline had a
gratification in taking them in her hand,
and examining them minutely: at last,
she found a small turquoise brooch
which she had often observed in his
neck-handkerchief; it had apparently
been originally meant for a woman’s
ornament. Emmeline had on one almost
exactly similar. The temptation
to exchange them was too strong to be
resisted—with trembling fingers she undid
her own pin; but again carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>examined Fitzhenry’s, for fear of his detecting
the exchange. At the back of
his, in small letters, she saw “Firenze,”
but they were almost worn away; her
courage however nearly failed her,
although she thought she might contrive
to scratch something on her own
broach to resemble the inscription,
but, just at that minute, Lady
Saville, who had finished her book of
caricatures, and looked at every thing in
the room, coming up, proposed their
proceeding to the rest of the house—Emmeline
almost started with the embarrassment
of guilt: she had no time
for further doubt, she hastily threw
down on the marble-slab her own
brooch, and carried off her husband’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>Almost terrified at what she had done,
when they met in the drawing-room before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>dinner, she looked anxiously at
Fitzhenry’s handkerchief, but, when he
turned towards the light, she had the
satisfaction to see her own pin placed as
usual, and, consequently, that he had not
discovered her robbery.</p>

<p class='c014'>To those who may be inclined to
think the feelings of Emmeline on such
a trifle exaggerated, we have only to
say, that proving themselves never to
have been <i>in love</i> we can no more attempt
to speak to their feelings than to describe
colours to a person born blind.</p>

<p class='c014'>Delighted and elated with her prize,
poor Emmeline’s spirits rose above their
now usual state, and when, after dinner,
Lady Saville declared she wanted exercise
to get rid of a headache, and
proposed dancing, Emmeline readily
forwarded her wish and offered her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>service as musician. Every one willingly
acquiesced, and they soon made
up a quadrille. Fitzhenry and Mr. Pelham
were the only two who did not join
in the dance, but continued standing
over the fire, seemingly engaged in very
earnest conversation. When the quadrille
was ended, Emmeline played a
waltz; this was still less to be resisted,
and the whole party immediately swung
round the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can play a waltz,” said Mrs. Danvers,
the purse-making young lady’s
mother, who had just then entered the
room—”I can’t bear to see you, Lady
Fitzhenry, labouring at the pianoforte, do
let <i>me</i> play who can do nothing else;
and do you go and join the dancers.”—And
she insisted on Emmeline resigning
her post.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>All were engaged: there was no
one left to waltz with. Emmeline was
young; by nature gay, she liked dancing
as all gay young people do. The music,
the sight of others dancing, all had revived
her former love for the amusement,
and, not liking to deprive any one
else of her partner, she set off alone
after the rest. Unsupported, and lately
out of practise, she soon grew giddy,
the room turned round, she knew not
where she went, and, to save herself
from falling, she caught hold of something
she had run against, putting her
other hand over her eyes till the dizziness
had gone off. When it had subsided,
still keeping her hold, she looked
up to see where she was.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was her husband’s arm she had
hold of.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>She could scarcely check a scream
of alarm which burst from her on seeing
what she had done: she hastily withdrew
her hand, her flushed cheek turning
deadly pale. Fitzhenry was looking
at her attentively, but with apparent
surprise, and indeed, even apparent displeasure.</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole occurrence, which did not
occupy above a minute, had been mistaken
by the dancers. They thought she
was proposing to him to waltz with her,
and Mr. Moore hastily said, “That is
right, Lady Fitzhenry; make that lazy
fellow dance. No one waltzes so well
or <i>was</i> so fond of it; and it is too ridiculous
his giving himself already the airs
of an old married man!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lord and Lady Fitzhenry dance together!
Oh! that will be charming,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>exclaimed Miss Selina, clapping her
hands in foolish ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come, come along, Fitzhenry,” rejoined
Mr. Moore: “don’t be bashful;
ask Lady Fitzhenry in proper form to
do you the favour of dancing with you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly,” said Ernest, rather embarrassed:
“certainly—with pleasure,
if Lady Fitzhenry wishes——I mean,
if she will waltz with me, and can get
no better partner.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I never meant that—I was only
giddy——,” said Emmeline, hardly
knowing what she said or did. The
other waltzers stopped. “Now, Lady
Fitzhenry, we will follow you,” said the
persecuting Mr. Moore. Any further
explanation or objection was impossible:
waltz together they must—and
Fitzhenry put his arm round her.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>All those who talk of the waltz as of a
dance possessing no other attraction, no
more interest than that of any other,
and owing the ill name it bears merely
to a cry raised against it by prejudice
in a country where as yet it is but newly
introduced, have never waltzed with <i>him</i>
or <i>her</i> they love; for then their own feelings
would answer, and silence them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline felt her husband’s arm
round her waist; her hand was clasped
in his, and his breath played on her
forehead. Her feelings almost overcame
her! Her heart beat so violently that she
could hardly breathe, and again her head
turned round.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry, as Mr. Moore had said,
was an excellent waltzer—he had waltzed
much at Vienna, where his intimacy with
Lady Florence had commenced by her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>teaching him this very dance. Without
any seeming effort, he bore along Emmeline’s
slight form—for already she
could hardly support herself. She fancied
he pressed her more closely to him—it
could, alas! be only fancy; but quite
overcome, and complaining of faintness,
she begged him, in a scarcely audible
voice, to stop. He immediately withdrew
his arm, took her to a chair, and
seeing her really near fainting, fetched
her a glass of water.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every thing conspired to overpower
poor Emmeline: it was with difficulty
she restrained her tears, and as soon as
she could trust herself to walk, she left
the room. But no Fitzhenry followed to
ask an explanation of her conduct; and
in darkness, and alone, she no longer
endeavoured to stifle her feelings. Fitzhenry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>was evidently annoyed: there
had been an expression of displeasure,
of formal, almost ironical civility on his
countenance, when forced to offer himself
as her partner, that she had never
seen before, and which penetrated her
heart. And then, though mere common
compassion had made him assist her
when unwell, yet it was almost beyond
his usual coldness to allow her to leave
the room alone, careless of what had
affected her, or whether she had recovered
or not.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was impossible to endeavour to explain
herself before others, and Fitzhenry
now carefully avoided their ever
being <i>tête-à-tête</i>. “Thus ends,” thought
Emmeline, “the vain dream—the last
hope of ever winning him! Indifference
is growing into dislike; and soon we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>shall be more than total strangers to
each other.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As she uttered these words, a gentle
knock at the door made her heart beat.
It could only be him—and in an instant
passing to the most delightful anticipations,
with a trembling voice, she gave
leave to enter. The door opened: but even
through the darkness of the room, she soon
saw her mistake, for it was merely Lady
Saville who came to enquire after her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Lady Fitzhenry,” said she,
“I fear you are not well, so I ventured
to come and doctor you a little.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! it is nothing,” replied Emmeline,
with difficulty restraining fresh tears
of disappointment: “I have not waltzed
lately, and it made me very giddy, that
is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And perhaps you should not have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>waltzed now,” added Lady Saville; “for
really you have not been looking well
lately; we have all remarked it. You
overfag yourself with your constant endeavours
to amuse our good country
neighbours, and with those long rides
which you will take, for I am sure you
are not strong.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline, wishing to avoid all conversation
on the subject of her looks and
health, conscious that both had suffered
from her loss of happiness, hastily got up,
declaring she was quite recovered; and,
after bathing her eyes and temples with
some cold water, she proposed returning
to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But are you quite sure you are well
enough?” said Lady Saville—”had you
not better lie down a little, for you still
look pale.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Emmeline insisted on going.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I understand your not liking
to make a fuss and excite enquiries; for
one’s friends will teaze one so with remedies:
so if you are really able, come
along, lean on me;” and she drew Emmeline’s
arm within hers.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they entered the room, Fitzhenry
went up to them: hoped Emmeline
was quite recovered, and brought a chair
for her; but all was done in cold civility,
and no more passed. Mr. Pelham came
immediately and sat by her, evidently
and purposely entering into conversation
to save her from being an object of attention
to the rest. The dancing went
on; but Emmeline’s spirits were gone,
and she took no more part in what
passed around her that evening.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“What capital fun we have had!”
said Selina, as they all left the
drawing-room for the night. “I am sure
I could dance all day long: could not
you, Lady Fitzhenry? Don’t you like
dancing of all things? I am sure you
must, you dance so well.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline absently answered—”I
<i>have</i> liked it, but it is a taste that soon
goes off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Soon, indeed!” said Mrs. Danvers,
who had been playing the waltzes and
quadrilles to them for the last hour, “if it
is already gone with you: why you talk
as if you were an old woman, Lady
Fitzhenry. I don’t think it is many
months since I saw you apparently
enjoying the amusement as much as
any one—indeed, not many minutes.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Emmeline, vexed at her forgetfulness,
did not answer. She saw her husband’s
eyes were fixed upon her; and,
anxious to put an end to so disagreeable
an evening, wishing them all
good night, she hastened into her own
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>When there, she found that the
brooch—the precious brooch, was missing.
She dared not tell her maid of her
loss, for fear that any enquiry after it
would lead to a discovery of her theft;
but, as soon as she was gone, and all
quiet in the house, Emmeline examined
every part of her own room, of the gallery,
and of the drawing-room; but all in
vain. Tired and annoyed, she was at last
obliged to give up the search, trusting
that daylight would betray its hiding
place.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>The</span> next morning, before her maid
came to her, Emmeline renewed her
search, but with as little success as on
the night before. It delayed her dressing;
and when she entered the breakfast-room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>all were assembled—Mr. Moore
coming in at an opposite door at
the same minute.</p>
<p class='c014'>“Who owns a turquoise pin?” said
he, in a loud, sententious voice, as he
approached the breakfast table, “with
some mysterious, and, I conclude, very
sentimental letters at the back.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry, who was reading the newspaper,
instantly laid it down. He felt
for his brooch, and forgetting that he
had not put on any that morning, exclaimed,
at the same moment with
Emmeline—”I do!” Both looked at
each other, and coloured.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I never knew such a pattern
pair,” said Moore; “they have so conscientiously
every thing in common,
that they have but one brooch between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>them, and I suppose wear it alternately.
Pin of my pin—brooch of my brooch,”
added he, laughing: “without the help
of Solomon, I really don’t know how to
decide the matter between you, for it is
quite a law case in his line, and much
beyond me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pray give it me,” said Emmeline,
in a low voice, inexpressibly annoyed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The brooch is mine,” said Fitzhenry,
holding out his hand for it, and
apparently not much less discomposed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold, if you please,” said Moore;
“I have not studied the law, up three
pair of stairs in Lincoln’s Inn, and
poured over musty books for nothing. I
must have proofs and witnesses before I
adjudge the disputed prize. Let us call
into court the letters at the back, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>may throw some light on the subject—Let
me see,” continued he, putting on
his nose the spectacles of one of the company,
and affecting an important, legal
tone, “<i>Fi</i> is very easily distinguished,
but what the deuce is it that comes between
that and <i>z e</i>, which are plainly the
letters at the end. <i>F i</i> looks a little as
if it really did belong to one Lord Fitzhenry,
I must own; (if he is so unsentimental
as to wear his own name next
his heart;) but even under that extraordinary
supposition, I can’t turn <i>z e</i>
into <i>r y</i> by any trick of law or logic—so
I am still at a loss; for do what I will, I
cannot, with these letters, spell <i>fidele</i>, or
<i>fidelità</i>, or any of those pretty words.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline said no more; she tried to
busy herself with the breakfast-things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>but poured out every thing wrong, and
made all sorts of strange mistakes. Fitzhenry
got up, and went to Mr. Moore.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come, Moore, no more of this nonsense;
give me the brooch, and Lady
Fitzhenry and I can afterwards settle to
which of us it belongs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“As lord of the manor, I suppose
you claim all stray goods,” rejoined
Moore; “otherwise I must say yours is
a most despotic measure, and a little
like the lion in the fable.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this, Miss Danvers, who had been
some time tittering, burst into an immoderate
fit of laughter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How droll Mr. Moore is!” she exclaimed:
“pray, Lord Fitzhenry, let me
look at this brooch; there is such a fuss
about it that it must be something very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>extraordinary, and I am sure I could
make out the letters,” said she, looking
significantly at Moore, “for I know all
sorts of mottos, and sentiments, and those
kind of things, for brooches, and bracelets,
and purses, and seals,”—and she
held out her hand for the brooch.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not worth looking at,” said Fitzhenry,
coldly, as he put it into his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think the lion is a little gruff,”
whispered the young lady to her neighbour
at the breakfast-table, and again
laughed violently at what she imagined
to be wit.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” she continued, “I give notice,
that when I marry, I mean to have my
own way, and be my own mistress, and
not be so submissive as Lady Fitzhenry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>I shall have as many brooches as I please,
given me by whom I please; for I suspect,”
added she, significantly, “there is
some story about this brooch—some mystery
we none of us know; but I am determined
I will find it out: it is just the
sort of thing I like—and see how Lady
Fitzhenry blushes—I am getting near
the mark, I suspect.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t rattle on so foolishly, Selina,”
said her mother, trying to check her
talkative daughter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is what mamma always says,”
retorted Miss Danvers, pettishly, and
looking round for support in her denial
of the charge of folly. “Mamma never
lets me speak, which is very hard, for
I am sure I am saying no harm,”
added she, addressing Mr. Moore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>whom she seemed to have dubbed her
champion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never presume to contradict mammas,”
answered he; “otherwise I should
say that such a mouth could never utter
any thing which it would not be agreeable
to hear.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young lady giggled, and, encouraged
by the compliment, went on—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pray, Mr. Moore, <i>seriously</i>, as you
are a lawyer, will you tell me, have
husbands a right by law to read all their
wives’ letters, as well as seize on their
naughty brooches? Lady Fitzhenry,
does Lord Fitzhenry read all your letters?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should think he would be sorry
to take the trouble,” said Emmeline,
forced to reply to so direct a question,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>although from the quickness with which
one silly idea chased another in Selina’s
mind, she seldom required any
answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why? have you a great many correspondents?
I do so like correspondents,
don’t you? and to get letters all
crossed, and written under the seal, and
every where; is it not delightful? I
have so many friends I doat upon, that
there is not a day I don’t write two or
three long letters, and tell them every
thing I feel and think; and then it passes
away the morning so well; don’t it,
Mr. Moore?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, I really cannot boast of as
many confidential friends, or as much
capacity of heart as you seem to be
blessed with,” said he; “and, moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>I have nothing to confide; so that I fear
a very small note would contain all my
feelings and thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear, how shocking! and how odd!
I have so many charming friends, to
whom I have so much to say, that I
could write to them for ever; and then,
when we have nothing particular to tell,
we suppose ourselves people in a novel,
and so carry on a story, you know, under
feigned names: mine is Celestina.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It must be very interesting; and
may I ask,” continued Moore, “who is
the hero worthy of such a heroine?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, that I won’t tell,” said Miss
Danvers, slyly—”that is a secret; but, if
you choose to guess, I will tell you when
you are wrong. So far I will go; but
I won’t allow of any questions about tall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>and short, and fat and thin, and that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here all laughed; and Selina, quite
satisfied that it was at her wit, glanced
round the table with an eye of triumph,
till, encountering Fitzhenry’s grave, preoccupied
countenance, which, plainly
showed that he had not joined in the
applause, she said: “Ah, Lord Fitzhenry
is still thinking of his brooch,
and of that blush of Lady Fitzhenry’s,
which seems to stick in his throat.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am sure you are very good to take
so much interest in what concerns us,”
replied Fitzhenry, dryly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no, it is not good at all; for it
is my greatest amusement to find out
every body’s little secrets, and I am
determined I will get at the bottom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>this somehow.” After a pause, she addressed
Emmeline. “By the bye, now
I recollect, you were very busy poking
about all Lord Fitzhenry’s things in his
room, yesterday morning; but what that
may have to do with all this, I can’t
just now make out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry looked up astonished, and his
eyes were fixed on Emmeline’s crimson
cheek; but, though he looked at her
attentively for a few minutes, he said
nothing; and, by this time, the frowns
from Mrs. Danvers had become so repeated,
and so decided, that they at last
succeeded in checking the exuberant
loquacity of the lively Selina.</p>

<p class='c014'>An awkward silence ensued; every
one seemed disconcerted, and Fitzhenry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>for the first time, to Emmeline’s observation,
appeared totally out of humour.
He soon got up from the breakfast-table,
and left the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a thoroughly wet day; even the
gentlemen could not go out—and, to pass
the morning, Lady Saville proposed
practising some songs, in which one of
them took a part. Poor Emmeline, who
could not rally her spirits at all, felt
little inclined to sing—but she complied,
till at length, fatigued and harassed, she
gave up her place at the pianoforte to
Selina, and went to her own room.
There on the table she found a note addressed
to her, in Fitzhenry’s handwriting.
She trembled as she opened
it—it contained her own brooch, and
these words:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span></div>
<div class='lh c011'>

<p class='c015'>“I return you, what I suppose to be
yours; how it came into my possession,
I know not. I have kept to my promise—I
do all in my power to promote your
happiness—do then the same by me, and
respect feelings which I have honestly
confessed to you.</p>
<div class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Fitzhenry.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Emmeline read this over and over,
scarcely knowing what the latter words
could refer to; so perfectly innocent
did she feel of any infringement of their
agreement, and so satisfied that she had
never, directly or indirectly, to him or
others, hinted at her cruel situation.
However, at last, calling to mind the way
in which Selina had that morning so
provokingly entertained the company
with her silly remarks, she felt convinced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>in spite of Fitzhenry’s well-known contempt
for the person who made them,
that they had raised suspicions in his
mind of her having taken advantage of
his absence to invade his apartment, and
pry into his secrets; perhaps had even
led him to imagine that she had stolen
his favourite brooch with the foolish intention
of wantonly tormenting him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wounded tenderness, and offended
pride, alternately wrung her heart. To
clear herself was impossible, without
confessing feelings, which she could not
bring herself to avow to one who evidently
despised and abhorred her. In
total despair at the cruelly unfavourable
light in which untoward circumstances
always placed her before him, whom it
was the first, almost the only wish of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>heart to conciliate and please, poor Emmeline
wept in bitterness of soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some explanation on her part, however,
was absolutely necessary, but it
was long before she could resolve on
what to say. At length, entering into no
particulars, she wrote merely these words.</p>

<div class='lh c011'>

<p class='c015'>“You do me great injustice, and totally
mistake me: explanation, however,
is impossible—indeed, would probably
be only uninteresting and irksome
to you, and therefore I shall not attempt
any.</p>
<div class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Emmeline.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>How to give this to Fitzhenry unnoticed
was the next difficulty, without the
risk of a <i>tête-à-tête</i> interview, which in
the present nervous and irritated state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of her feelings, she had no courage to
seek. She heard him in his room, which
joined to hers, and there he remained
all the morning alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>With her note concealed in her hand,
and with tell-tale eyes, Emmeline joined
the party at the usual hour of luncheon,
in case her absence might create surprise.
Mr. Pelham’s attention was soon
attracted towards her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I fear you have not yet recovered your
waltzing of last night,” said he kindly, as
if to account for her disordered appearance,
which no one could help observing:
“you have still a headache I am sure,
and I am not surprised at it. When you
<i>give balls</i>, you should put out your stoves;
I wonder how any of the dancers could
stand the heat of the room last night: a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>walk would do you good; I think it is
clearing up; will you let me accompany
you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline feeling, in spite of her endeavours,
that tears still forced themselves
into her eyes, and aware that she was not
quite in a fit state to make the <i>agréable</i> to
her company, readily agreed. The fresh
air revived and composed her, and, by
degrees, her usual spirits returned. Pelham
first talked on indifferent subjects.
At length, some improvement in the
place which he was observing, brought
in Fitzhenry’s name, when, after a moment’s
pause, he said—”I see my friend
Fitzhenry has no patience with that poor
silly girl, Miss Danvers. I have often
lectured him on the subject of his want
of toleration for folly, and of the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>that he is apt to take things that should
only be laughed at, <i>au grand serieux</i>. It
is the fault of all grave, substantial characters
like his; and he allows trifles to
go too deep with him. To be sure, the
poor Selina is a fool, <i>comme on en voit peu</i>;
but it is not necessary to attend to her,
and I should be almost tempted with
regard to her, to give <i>you</i> the same advice
as to Fitzhenry, not any way to
notice the nonsense that flows from her.
There are some people who can make
themselves important in society only
by teazing others; and if they once
find out this power, they never let it rest
unemployed. I am very impudent I
think,” added Pelham, “in presuming
to give you advice; but, as the friend
of Fitzhenry, I feel that I have a sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of established right to lecture even
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline looked up and smiled, to
show in what good part she took what
was so kindly meant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are very young, my dear Lady
Fitzhenry,” continued he; “very new to
the world, and your own character is
naturally so open, so natural,—that you
are perhaps <i>too</i> artless. Some part we
almost all must, to a degree, act in this
world. We are all sometimes obliged
to put a mask on our features and feelings.
You know I am a <i>diplomate</i> by
profession,” said Pelham, endeavouring
to give a light turn to his advice, seeing
how much at the moment his <i>thin skinned</i>
auditor needed the mask he talked of.
“Fitzhenry has been much used to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>world—to women of the world,” continued
he, with a quick, embarrassed
manner. “Perhaps <i>you</i> are too much
without art, for him to believe you artless,
paradoxical as this may sound. In
short, as you are destined to live in a
wicked, unfeeling world, I could, I believe,
wish you to be a little more wicked
and unfeeling yourself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this moment, Fitzhenry, with his
gun and dogs, appeared at a little distance,
and when he saw them, came
towards them. It was fortunate, for it
would have been difficult for Pelham and
Emmeline to have extricated themselves
from the conversation in which they were
engaged; for, vague as it might have
appeared to any third person, those concerned
both feared they had gone too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>far; the one, in what he had said, the
other, in what she had listened to.</p>

<p class='c014'>As Fitzhenry approached, Emmeline
resolved she would endeavour to exert
that degree of self-control which Pelham
recommended, and a feeling of
offended pride, and of injustice towards
her on Fitzhenry’s part, enabled her to
succeed. She drew her bonnet over her
face, and though her heart beat, and at
first her voice trembled, she forced herself
to speak on indifferent subjects, as
if nothing had past, or rather, as if what
<i>had</i> passed, had not had power to wound
her; and, taking an opportunity when
Pelham was a yard or two behind, she
held out her note to Fitzhenry. For a
minute, he seemed reluctant to take it;
but the next, received it from her hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and putting it hastily within his waistcoat,
immediately began talking with
Pelham about the view he was then
looking at.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they met at dinner-time, Fitzhenry’s
manner to her was as usual;
but the party was so large, that they
could have little intercourse. In the
evening, to avoid any possibility of the
waltzing scene of the preceding night,
Emmeline immediately took out her
work, about which she pretended to be
particularly interested, and left the rest
of the party to provide for their own
amusement.</p>

<p class='c014'>She and Fitzhenry still appeared to
be the objects of Mr. Moore’s particular
observation, and for that purpose, seating
himself by Emmeline, “I hope Lady Fitzhenry,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>said he, “you have forgiven me
for not proving myself a better advocate
for you this morning; but really Fitzhenry’s
frowns were so very <i>eloquent</i> and
<i>convincing</i>, that I could say no more on
the subject.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you need not say more now,”
answered Fitzhenry, rather impatiently,
without taking his eyes from the Review
he was reading; “that foolish affair is
settled; we have both our own, and both
are satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Alas!” thought Emmeline, “how
much he is mistaken!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Moore looked at them alternately with
an air of incredulity. “Well, you are
strange mysterious people,” said he;
“but if you are content, I am sure so
am I;” and, laying his hand on the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>book he saw, and which proved to be
Childe Harold, he read some lines of it
aloud.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you a great admirer of Lord
Byron, Lady Fitzhenry?” said he.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course,” replied Emmeline, forcing
a smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course of his poetry,” continued
Moore; “but I hope <i>not</i> of his sentiments:
his descriptions of scenery are
beautiful, and sometimes those of feeling
and affection; but when he comes to
paint his own dark, venom-spitting
mind, he is hateful; and it always provokes
me, that he should feel the beauties
of nature so deeply, and not be the
better for that feeling. Have you ever
been in Italy, Lady Fitzhenry?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, never,” said Emmeline shortly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>not much liking to get on such tender
ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should have sworn you had; I have
heard you talk as if you knew all Italy
by heart; and you have in your composition,
that suavity of mind and temper,
which the sun, the air, the beauteous
scenes of Italy, the dark blue of its seas
give. I should have been ten times
more detestable than I am, had I not
passed so much of my life in the pure,
soft atmosphere of Italy. I don’t know,
by the bye, that my friend Fitzhenry
there proves my doctrine true; I don’t
think he has benefited much by such
education; vide the pin affair. But I
suppose it is only the effect of change
of climate, and that the cold, dark fogs
of this country, have again contracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>his heart, and made it selfish and English.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry said nothing, and apparently
was engrossed by his book. Mr.
Moore continued. “Many a battle Fitzhenry
and I have had about Lord Byron—I
wonder what side you would take.
I never can feel for his imaginary woes.
What the deuce is the matter with the
fellow? what does he want? He has
had every thing this world can give. All
the fools and fine ladies running after
him, and paying him court <i>à l’envi l’un
de l’autre</i>; and yet he went grumbling
and whining about, despising, and turning
up his nose at us all, who are ten
times better than himself. He chose,
too, to hate and ill-treat his wife, after
he had insisted, almost against her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>will, or at least against her judgment,
to marry her, and she an heiress, into
the bargain. This was to be a new distress;
and on this he begun, <i>de plus belle</i>,
to grumble and whine, and moreover to
blackguard. Now, Fitzhenry, how do
you defend all this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t pretend to defend him in
any thing,” said Fitzhenry, very impatiently;
“I only say, that persons with
totally different feelings and characters
cannot judge of each other. What
would be keen suffering to one, might
be none to another. I might answer
you in the words of Madame de
Staël—”<i>Les gens mediocres ne cessent de
s’étonner que le talent ait des besoins differens
des leurs</i>; and as for Lord Byron’s
private history, neither you nor I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>any business with it, or know any thing
about it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The deuce we don’t?” said Moore,
“many thanks, <i>par parenthese</i>, for your
pretty compliment to me, <i>au sujet de la
mediocrité</i>; but we will let that pass: I
am well used to such from you,” said he,
laughing; “but I cannot give up so quietly
Lord Byron, who certainly has had
the bad taste (to say no worse) to take
pains to tell us all what a villain he is,
so that few of us can be ignorant of his
private history.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry said nothing; and resuming
his book, turned away, as if the light
hurt his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Fitzhenry, don’t <i>you</i> agree
with me about Lord Byron,” continued
the indefatigable Moore.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“I believe not,” said Emmeline with
a tremulous voice—”I <i>should</i> not—I
think no one can, or should presume to
judge of the feelings, hardly of the situation
and conduct of another.” An involuntary
sigh finished the sentence;
fortunately it escaped her neighbour’s
ear, as he was hastily turning over the
leaves of the book, reading a line here
and there.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Il faut pourtant etre juste</i>,” said
Moore; “and, to give the devil his due,
Lord Byron is in truth a most delightful
poet. We all find that he describes
our own thoughts and feelings, which
we have not had the wit to put into
rhyme ourselves. Here is a pretty
specimen of sing-song sentiment, for
instance:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span></div>
<div class='lh c011'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Florence, whom I will love as well</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As ever yet was said or sung,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>(Since Orpheus sang his spouse from hell,)</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Whilst thou art fair, and I am young;</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in1'>Had bards as many realms as rhymes,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thy charms might raise new Anthonies.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Though fate forbids such things to be,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yet, by thine eye and ringlets curled,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I cannot lose a world for thee,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But would not lose thee for a world.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c013'>Prudent vows those, making them to
depend on his own youth, and his fair
one’s beauty. What think you of that
moral sentiment, Lady Fitzhenry?”</p>
<p class='c014'>Emmeline dared not speak; she feared
a double meaning might be given to
whatever she said; but the crimson on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>her cheeks betrayed how well she knew
the lines. Fitzhenry, for an instant,
looked up—his face was scarcely less
suffused than hers, and hastily rising
from his seat, he left the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Alas!” thought Emmeline, “again
he will accuse me of braving him; of
purposely wounding his feelings!” and it
was with difficulty she could conceal
from Mr. Moore how much he had discomposed
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day, when she went through
the gallery, the door of Fitzhenry’s room
chanced to be open, and as her eyes
eagerly wandered into it, she observed
that the two drawings had disappeared
from over the chimney. What this meant,
she could but too well guess: she plainly
saw that he suspected her of meanly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>endeavouring to pry into his feelings,
and to trace each thought inimical to
herself, with a view (perhaps he concluded)
to gain at least the power of tormenting
him, when hopeless of obtaining
any other. “Oh, Fitzhenry!”
thought she, “will the time ever come,
when you will know me better, and learn
to do me justice?”</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Parliament</span> met early this year, and
Lord Fitzhenry signified his intention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of being in town at its opening. The
party at Arlingford, therefore, before
long, dispersed different ways; and,
with a heavy heart, Emmeline went to
settle herself in Grosvenor-street.
Young as she was, and disposed for
gaiety as she had been but a few
months past, she could, in her circumstances,
only look to the world and to
the routine of fashionable life in London
with dismay. She would be thrown
into a totally new society, where she
had not a friend, scarcely an acquaintance.
Had Fitzhenry been to her what
he ought, how proudly would she, at
her lover’s side, have shown herself to
an admiring world, as the being he had
chosen. But this was not the situation
of Emmeline, and she shrunk with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>feeling of apprehension from the tumult
in which she would be left deserted and
solitary.</p>
<p class='c014'>She foresaw, too, that a London life
would necessarily throw her and her
husband more apart; for, little as she
saw of him in the country, yet still
in the course of the day she was certain
of being in his society and of
hearing his voice, although seldom now
addressed in conversation to herself.
In town, it would be easier for him to
avoid her, and she much feared he
would take advantage of the opportunities
offered.</p>

<p class='c014'>And Emmeline was right in her conjectures.
Under pretence of business, and
attendance at the House of Commons,
he was so constantly from home, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>they rarely met. Their hours, too, were
different; breakfast was no longer a
certain moment for meeting; for, as it
would now have obliged them to a daily
<i>tête-à-tête</i>, it was brought to them in
their separate apartments. During the
morning, therefore, it was only by accident
that they were ever together. Fitzhenry
rarely dined at home, except when
there was company; and, of course, living
so much apart, Emmeline did not
even know what his evening engagements
were; and often they met by
chance, for the first time, during forty-eight
hours, in some distant place of
amusement. If then he chanced to give
her a look of kind recognition, poor
Emmeline went home with her spirits
raised, resolving to improve the advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>she fancied she had gained; but
again, forty-eight hours passed in the
same manner, and, perhaps, if then
again they accidentally met, he would
scarcely notice her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus deserted, she saw she must
submit to endeavour to make to herself
an independent existence; but it was
a vain attempt when every thought,
every feeling was with him. Lady
Saville had offered herself as Emmeline’s
<i>chaperon</i>, on her first entry into
the world of London society, and she
could not have had a better companion;
for Lady Saville had just feeling
enough to enable her to perform all
her social duties without a shadow of
blame, and even in her own set to
obtain the character of being remarkably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>goodnatured;—but she had none
of those refined sentiments, which
could lead her to read and detect
the emotions of Emmeline’s heart.
Pre-occupation of mind, variation of
spirits and complexion, on a look
or word; all such symptoms of a
stricken heart she attributed to mere
physical causes; sometimes rallying
Emmeline on her <i>vapeurs</i>, but generally
too much amused and occupied
herself to doubt her companion being
equally so. Had that companion’s
heart been gay and free as it was but
a few months back, what attractions
the world, into which she was now, for
the first time, introduced, might have
had for her!</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline’s beauty had much improved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>since her marriage, and even by
her loss of happiness; for, in the place
of the mere expression of youthful joy
and good-humour, was a look of <i>sentiment</i>,
almost of languor, over her whole
countenance and person, that added
inexpressibly to its charm, and gave
additional effect to her own peculiarly
bright smile, when it was sometimes
for a moment recalled.</p>

<p class='c014'>As Fitzhenry’s wife, she first attracted
attention; and, with pleasing
manners, rank, riches, youth, and
beauty at once to recommend her, she
was soon sought for, admired, and
courted; and had she been willing to
take advantage of the universal cry in
her favour, Emmeline might, with little
or no trouble on her part, have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>raised to that envied distinction, obtained
no one knows how, or why, of
being the <i>fashion</i>. For the world is
so capricious and wayward in its preferences,
that it often greets beings like
Lady Fitzhenry (from circumstances regardless
of its favour) with those winning,
gracious smiles, which it perversely
withholds from others most indefatigable
in their efforts to obtain them. Witness
the anxious and fatiguing labours of so
many candidates for its patronage, their
eternal struggles to grasp at what constantly
escapes them, if for a moment
they pause to take breath, or relax the
little hold they have secured.</p>

<p class='c014'>When individuals are blamed for either
too much or too little love of the world,
the different welcome it bestows seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>little considered. How little does the
situation of a courted, fashionable girl,
surrounded by partners and admirers,
and thus at liberty to give herself every
impertinent air, which a vain mind, and
a selfish, unfeeling heart dictate, resemble
that of the unobserved, disregarded
being, who, night after night, follows
some elderly, undistinguished <i>chaperon</i>
through the regular round of London
amusements, and, seated by her hour
after hour in dull neglect, seems at
last to become a part of the bench she
rests on, till reduced, perhaps, to be
even envious of its insensibility; yet
the same enlivening music plays to
both; the same bright lights are cast
on both, and the same glittering, buzzing
crowd surrounds them; but question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>them, after their night’s dissipation,
as to the entertainment at which they
were both present, and how different
will be their accounts of the same scene—of
what is called the gay world! of
all worlds the most melancholy to
those who are not gay.</p>

<p class='c014'>And Emmeline, in spite of her general
popularity, was among that number:
how far she might equally have resisted
its snares, and despised its pleasures,
had there been corresponding
joy within, we cannot pretend to say;
but, as it was, the first transient amusement
produced by novelty, very soon
went off, leaving her mind wearied
and depressed, and, at any time, in
the gayest scene, the sight of Fitzhenry
at a distance, in the crowd of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>ball-room, or at the opera, had power
instantly to dispel every feeling of enjoyment;
and then, totally regardless of
what passed around her, or of the flattering
compliments addressed to her, her
eyes were rivetted to the spot where
he was, busied in the eager examination
of those near him, in search of that
form, those features, which had captivated
him; and often when she had
observed him engrossed in conversation
with any woman, or even when
merely paying the common attentions
of civility, breathless with agitation,
she has enquired who the favoured
being was, as if in strange eagerness
“most to seek what she would most
avoid;” but still Lady Florence never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>appeared; her dreaded name was never
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although now, to all appearance,
totally deserted by her husband, still
he kept strictly to his engagement
with her. Every possible indulgence
and pleasure which money could give,
were hers; and in such outward attentions
he even seemed occupied about
her. The horse she rode at Arlingford,
although formerly his favourite hunter,
was now considered as entirely hers, and
without her even expressing a wish on
the subject, had been brought to town
for her exclusive use; he had himself
secured a box at the opera for her,
after having ascertained in what part
of the house she would prefer it; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>on their first arrival in town, he had
again repeated his desire, that she
should ask any and every one she
liked to the house. In short, she was
again and again enjoined to consult only
her own happiness and enjoyment in
every thing: kind words in the mouth
of any other husband; but, producing
the painful conviction of her loneliness,
they brought but tears into Emmeline’s
eyes, when hastily pronounced by Fitzhenry,
with his hand on the lock of the
door, in order that he might leave her
the instant they were uttered, and so
escape the possibility of thanks or comment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wishing, however, to show that she
was sensible of his intended kindness, in
the liberty he gave, and with a last faint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>hope, that by making his home agreeable,
she might entice him to be more
with her, Emmeline determined to endeavour
to collect society at her house.
She took a favourable moment to inform
Fitzhenry of her intention, and of the
nights for which she had made the invitations.
He seemed much to approve of
the plan, but said nothing as to his own
attendance.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the day appointed for the first
party, Emmeline, as was generally now
the case, dined alone. During her solitary
repast, she made firm resolutions
that she would act upon the advice Pelham
had given her at Arlingford—put that
mask on her feelings which he recommended,
and adopt those manners of the
world that he said Fitzhenry admired.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Emmeline had a sort of natural <i>tact</i> on
all such subjects; and, had she been
in the habit of doing the honours of her
own house, during her whole life, she
could not have acquitted herself better.
All were delighted with her, and with
the evening’s amusement. It was not
till towards the close of it, that Fitzhenry
appeared. Long had poor Emmeline’s
eyes anxiously wandered toward
the door, watching for his entrance;
and when at last he came, it
was not without difficulty that she continued
to perform her gay part with
spirit; but a momentary break in what
she was saying—a rapid beating of her
heart, and the deepened colour in her
cheek, alone betrayed her agitation at
his presence.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>He came up to her; remarked how
well the rooms were lighted; complimented
her on the disposal of the furniture—on
her arrangement of the flowers:
and, in return, the poor hypocrite played
her part well. She carelessly asked
his opinion as to the placing of the
lamps and the pianoforte. Even attempted
at rallying him on his absence;
and to all appearance no two people
could be on an easier footing.</p>

<p class='c014'>The company were by this time beginning
to clear away. As they dispersed,
Emmeline eagerly looked around
for Fitzhenry. She thought he had noticed
her more than usual, and she determined
to follow up this little fancied
success, by assuming a careless gaiety,
which she certainly did not feel, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>which she sometimes believed she would
do well to adopt. When, therefore, she
had performed her last act of civility to
her last guest, she hurried back to the
spot where she had left him. But he
too had disappeared. Alone she paced
the now silent, empty rooms, lost in
thought, and totally forgetful of the lateness
of the hour, until at length, the
entrance of Reynolds rousing her from
her trance, she hastily retired into her
own room—but not to sleep.—Various
thoughts agitated her mind: sometimes
even hope, (albeit of late not a usual
visitor,) forced itself in: Fitzhenry had
certainly smiled on her; he had appeared
pleased; had even seemed to
take interest in her attempt, and she determined
to persevere.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Emmeline counted the days to her
next party, as a school-girl does those to
her first ball; for, on its success she again
built flattering expectations for the future—expectations
which perhaps to herself
were hardly to be defined. “But at all
events, I shall certainly see him,” she
thought, as with most excuseable care
and anxiety she endeavoured to improve,
to the best advantage, those personal attractions
which nature had bestowed
upon her. But in vain she decked her
hair with the freshest flowers; in vain
she listened for, and anxiously watched
the result of, each loud knock at her
door. Every one she had asked, flew
to her invitation, (such is the power of
novelty in London,) all but <i>him</i> for whom
the whole had been prepared.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Disheartened and dispirited, poor Emmeline
almost resolved on seeking some
pretext for putting off altogether her
third entertainment; but a good humoured
word of recognition from her
husband, as they met in the lobby of the
opera-house, the Tuesday before, again
made her yield to the natural buoyancy
of her disposition; and Fitzhenry, having
asked Pelham and the Savilles to
dine with him on the day appointed for
her party, his presence seemed thus secured.
All now, therefore, appeared
propitious to Emmeline. Fitzhenry himself
was, on that day, evidently more
disposed for cheerfulness than he had
been of late; and the smallness of their
party at dinner, obliging them to more
intercourse than they had had for long,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Emmeline gave way to the exhilaration
of spirits belonging to youth and hope,
and, her cheeks again bright with the
flush of enjoyment, she bore her part in
the conversation with unusual liveliness.
Emmeline was aware of this herself, and
could not, moreover, help indulging in
the flattering idea, that even Fitzhenry
had (at least for that once) thought her
agreeable. With a step made still more
light than usual by the innocent exultation
of the moment, she gaily bounded up
to the drawing-room with Lady Saville,
to make the necessary preparations for
the expected company. Knowing how
much Fitzhenry liked music, she had
collected all the best Italian singers;
and, with her companion, Emmeline was
still occupied in arranging the lights and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>instruments, when Pelham and Sir
George Saville joined them, but not
Fitzhenry. Coffee came; still he did
not appear. Half fearful of what she
might learn, but not able to bear the
suspense any longer, she at length, with
an anxious look, enquired whether he
was gone out.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no!” replied Pelham; “he is
only answering a letter which he has
just received; he will be here directly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A flash of her own bright smile instantly
re-illumined her features; and
afterwards, in the middle of one of
Camporese’s beautiful songs, it glanced
again over her countenance, for she saw
Fitzhenry enter the room, and, for an
instant, caught his eyes fixed upon her.
But the song over, and after the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>stir and bustle that usually follows,
she looked for him in vain. The
crowd was now every minute thickening,
and with difficulty Emmeline forced
herself to address to each those common-place
remarks which always equally
weary those who make them, and those
to whom they are made. She restlessly
went from room to room on some excuse
to herself as well as others, but her
search was vain—he was gone!</p>

<p class='c014'>At once the bright scene totally
changed! although the music was beautiful,
and the buzz of gaiety and happiness
went round. Poor Emmeline,
alone in the scene of enjoyment which
she had herself created, was wretched.
Gladly she at length saw her visitors
depart, and the rooms gradually become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>empty; for her spirits, which had been
so unusually excited, were totally exhausted,
and her only object now was,
the conclusion of that evening to which
she had looked with such bright expectation.
Lady Saville and Pelham remained
the last.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, my dear Lady Fitzhenry,”
said the former, “I staid to the end
purposely to congratulate you on the
full success of your <i>soirées</i>; nothing
could have gone off better than they
have done; every one declares that nobody
understands the matter so well as
Lady Fitzhenry. I wonder where you
learnt the art,” said she, as she looked,
with a complimentary smile, into Emmeline’s
face. On that face, tears were
slowly, and almost unconsciously stealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>down. “Good heavens! Lady
Fitzhenry!” exclaimed Lady Saville,
“what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing,” said Emmeline, provoked
at her weakness: “but however well
I may do the honours of my house, it is
a fatigue to which I am new, and perfectly
unequal. I have had a bad headache
all day; and I find the trouble of
being agreeable so much greater than
the reward, that however delightful my
parties may be, I shall attempt them no
more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Poor Emmeline spoke in the impatient
tone of vexation and disappointment—a
tone so unusually heard from
her lips, that Lady Saville looked at her
astonished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How very foolish!” she exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“when nothing of the sort, I am sure,
could succeed better, and when you
ought to be so pleased and flattered by
the general pleasure you have produced.
In your place, I should be quite delighted;
and then to give it all up
merely because you happen at this
minute to feel a little tired and exhausted,
particularly when you seemed
to enjoy it all so much yourself, as I
am sure you did only an hour ago.
What is it that has gone wrong to make
you change your mind so suddenly?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline only shook her head in reply;
but encountering Pelham’s grave
look, it recalled to her mind his counsels,
and brushing away her tears with
her hand, and forcing a smile, she said,
as gaily as she could—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Well, we need not discuss the matter
at present. I will think about it;
but really, now, I must drive you away,
and go to bed; for I am quite knocked
up; and you see fatigue has already
made a fool of me, as I dare say, if the
truth was told, I cried like a child to
think I had eaten my cake, and that these
delightful parties were over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Saville, taking her hint, was
preparing to depart, when Fitzhenry,
who, on returning home, had still seen
some carriages in the street, and therefore
thought he could venture up stairs,
entered the room. Lady Saville immediately
went up to him. “Oh, Lord
Fitzhenry! do second me; for I am
trying to persuade your capricious, perverse
wife, to give some more parties;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>for she says they don’t repay her for the
trouble; that they exhaust her, and
that she will have no more. Now have
they not been particularly agreeable?
and does she not play the part of lady
of the revels to perfection?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline, who, on her husband’s
entrance, had walked to the further end
of the room, now began busying herself
with a basket of flowers, forgetting that
she could no longer have any excuse
for the employment. As for Fitzhenry,
he too seemed rather embarrassed by
Lady Saville’s direct questions; but
soon recollecting himself—”I certainly
think Lady Fitzhenry would do very
wrong to give up what seemed to give
herself, as well as every one else, so
much pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Emmeline bent over the flowers to
hide her face, which was crimsoned
with pique and impatience, as she repeated
to herself—”What gives <i>me</i> so
much <i>pleasure!</i> and that is all I have
gained by my last attempt, still more
to deceive him as to my real character,
and real feelings. He thinks I am to be
satisfied with all this noise and empty
show of enjoyment; and that it will
make up to the worldly fool, the insensible
child, for the want of happiness!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Saville returned to her charge,
begging Emmeline would at once name
a day, and that she would again endeavour
to secure Camporese for her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Forced to answer, and no longer able
even to pretend occupation with the
flowers, she hastily composed herself;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>and, quietly saying she was too tired
then to think of the matter, held out
her hand to Lady Saville, wishing her
good night.</p>

<p class='c014'>The altered tone of Emmeline’s voice,
since he had last heard it, probably
struck Fitzhenry, for he hastily raised
his eyes towards her. Her countenance,
her manner, all was changed; the bright
colour in her cheeks was gone; the
smile that had played round her mouth
had vanished: Pelham’s eyes too were
fixed upon her, and Fitzhenry observed
it. Again he glanced at them both, and
then for some minutes seemed totally
lost in thought, till Lady Saville, moving
towards the door to go, and wishing
him good night, he was roused from his
reverie; he offered her his arm, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>both he and Pelham went down stairs
with her.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a few minutes, Emmeline listened
for Fitzhenry’s return—she almost hoped
he would enquire into the cause of what
he might deem her ill humour: in short,
at that moment, she felt she should be
glad of any opening from him that could
possibly bring matters to a crisis, however
painful that crisis might be; for she
felt as if it was impossible to go on enduring
her present existence. But, after
pacing the room for some time in nervous
anxiety, which increased on hearing a
footstep on the stairs, she was at length
obliged to give up even that hope, as
Reynolds alone entered the room, and
immediately after, she heard the door of
Fitzhenry’s apartment close.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Convinced that she had now done all
she could; that she had battled with her
fate as much as possible; and, seeing
that every exertion and endeavour to
please and win him, only seemed to cast
her further from him, she resolved to
give over the vain struggle, and for her
own sake, at least, endeavour in reality
to be the frivolous, heartless being he
thought her. And thus, in a sort of desperation,
flying from herself, and from a
cheerless home, which only reminded her
of her blighted youth and hopes, she followed
Lady Saville to every dissipation
that was proposed. The last, and apparently
the gayest, at every amusement;
bright with false smiles and false colours;
poor Emmeline endeavoured to conceal,
beneath excited spirits, an aching heart:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>but the labour was such, that it allowed
of no respite. One day left to herself,
her own sad reflections again rushed back,
and with increased acuteness—all her
disappointed, withered feelings, the suffering
present, and the cheerless future,
pressed upon her soul. To pause in the
mad career of dissipation was therefore
impossible. She danced, she laughed,
she talked. All shyness, all feeling even,
seemed to have vanished, and her eyes
sparkled with that feverish dazzle, so
unlike the bright sunshine of happiness,
but so often mistaken for it by a thoughtless,
uninterested observer. How falsely
do those of the world mutually pass sentence
on each other! Meeting, perhaps,
merely in the gay resorts of fashion, each
individual attributes to the other that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>worldliness and frivolity which belongs
to the scene, but which they apply to
the character—and how false such judgments
are, those may declare, who by
peculiar circumstances, or duty of some
sort, are drawn into such amusements,
when from natural disposition and taste
they may be particularly little suited to
enjoy them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline’s looks, health, even temper,
all seemed to suffer from the life
she now led. Often, after an evening of
apparent gaiety, on her return home,
she was so agitated, and so ill, that
many a night it was only by laudanum
that she obtained rest. Jenkins repeatedly
observed how “My Lady” was
changed; that she never now seemed to
know her own mind; that she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>often dress for an evening’s amusement,
and then, when the time came, dismiss
her carriage, and flinging herself, in all
her finery, on her bed, would cry bitterly;
till, like a child, she fell asleep
from mere fatigue; and then, next
morning, she would laugh at what she
called her nervous folly, and begin again
her life of hurry and laborious amusement.</p>

<p class='c014'>But poor Emmeline, made for better
things, felt humbled at herself. Was
this the life that a rational, accountable,
immortal being should lead? Alas! was
this the end of all those dreams of happiness
which illume the mind, and warm
the heart of youth? Worn out in body
and spirits, Emmeline longed for Arlingford
and quiet; and looked forward with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>something like pleasure to Easter, when
she concluded Fitzhenry would propose
going there.</p>

<p class='c014'>Amid all those who now buzzed and
fluttered around her, one friend always
followed her steps with interest, one
friend she always met with real pleasure.
That friend was Pelham. Although he
never, since the conversation at Arlingford,
had in the most distant manner
alluded to the estrangement between
her and her husband, yet she could
plainly perceive, that he was well aware
of their real situation; and she could not
help also observing, that, of late, Pelham
and Fitzhenry were less cordial together
than formerly, although both seemed still
anxious, when they met, to carry on the
farce of friendship. But Pelham came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>much less often to their house than he
used to do, and generally at those hours
when Fitzhenry was most likely to be
from home. This Emmeline every way
regretted, she always had felt as if he
was a link between them, and she had
even vaguely imagined that he might
some day have been the means of uniting
them; and, besides the dispiriting conviction
that thus, one by one, every hope
to which she clung gave way, she could
not help feeling painfully aware that it
was Pelham’s partiality to her, which
had estranged her husband from him.</p>

<p class='c014'>One evening at Almacks, Lady Saville,
with whom she had gone, being engaged
dancing, Emmeline had sought a refuge
from the heat and crowd in the tea-room,
and Pelham had followed her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Half serious, half jesting, he was attacking
her upon the life she now led, and
upon the impossibility of ever seeing her
quietly, and the eternal hurry of pleasure
and spirits in which he always found
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why I only do like others,” said
Emmeline, with forced gaiety.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps so,” replied Pelham. “But
you are not like those others whom you
imitate and follow. I am sure that all
this dissipation cannot satisfy <i>your</i> mind,
cannot make <i>you</i> happy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Perhaps</i> not,” said Emmeline, her
forced smile fading from her lips; for
<i>happiness</i> was a word which always
grated on her heart, and sounded harsh
in her ears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what can I do?—<i>il faut hurler</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span><i>avec les loups</i>,” added she, again endeavouring
to resume her gaiety.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This assumed levity cannot take me
in,” continued Pelham. “I am certain
it is impossible but that all this frivolity
and fatigue must wear out both your
mind and body. How different you were
at Arlingford! how little you then seemed
to anticipate pleasure from what you now
enter into so warmly!”</p>

<p class='c014'>These were all home truths, which
Emmeline could not answer, and she
merely stammered out, that she had now
no choice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed!” replied Pelham, warmly.
“You wrong your friends when you say
that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My friends?” repeated Emmeline,
sadly, “I have no friends to——” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>she stopped short, her own words, rousing
from the bottom of her heart painful
feelings, which she in vain endeavoured
to smother by dissipation; and which,
by hiding them from others, she hoped
to forget herself. She averted her head
from Pelham, and fixed her tearful eyes
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>Apparently fearful of going too far,
Pelham was also silent; he looked at her
with melancholy interest; he could not
help observing how greatly she was altered,
how much she had lost of the
graceful roundness of her form, and how
evidently</p>

<div class='lh c011'>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Concealment, like a worm in the bud,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Fed on her damask cheek.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>At that minute, Fitzhenry suddenly
entered the room, and, hastily coming up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>to Pelham, “I have been looking for you
this half hour,” said he; “I want to
speak to you for a minute.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry had spoken these words so
quick that it was not till he ended, that
the preoccupied look of his auditor
seemed to strike him; his eyes glanced
from him to Emmeline, and there remained
fixed. His sudden entrance had
brought the blood into her face, but could
not dispel from it the traces of emotion
which were very evident; and there
was a contrast between the expression
of her countenance, the listless neglect
of her whole person, and the glittering
trappings in which she was attired, that
must have struck and interested any one;
and which arrested her husband’s attention
so forcibly, that Emmeline blushed
still deeper beneath his gaze.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>This seemed to rouse him from the
sort of dream in which he appeared to
be lost; and suddenly turning to Pelham,
“I stopped at your house, and there
learnt you were here; I had no idea you
ever honoured such places with your presence
when you could possibly help it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sometimes, when the spirit moves
me,” answered Pelham, carelessly. “But
what is it you have to say to me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have a message to you from the
Speaker, with whom I have been dining,”
said Fitzhenry, as if suddenly recollecting
his errand, and he drew Pelham aside
for a minute. Emmeline then ventured
to raise her eyes upon her husband, and
could not help, with a sort of melancholy
pride, comparing him to those around
him, and exulting in his superiority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>look, air, and manner. When his conversation
with Pelham was over, he again
turned towards Emmeline, and again his
eyes were rivetted on her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have left off dancing, I think,
Lady Fitzhenry,” said he, as if he thought
it necessary to say something, and hardly
knew what; “I thought you had liked it.
Pelham, do you ever dance now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is some time since I was guilty of
any thing so frisky,” he replied. “I
should be afraid I might be thought not
behaving myself with proper diplomatic
gravity; but as for Lady Fitzhenry, I must
say that, in her, it is pure laziness, and
therefore most reprehensible, for I have
myself heard many a humble application
made to her during this last half hour.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We take to ourselves the right to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>fanciful and capricious, you know,” said
Emmeline, trying to smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, and caprice is sometimes the
only thing women are steady to,” replied
Fitzhenry; while an expression of satirical
displeasure seemed to curl his handsome
lip.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline felt she no way deserved
that severe remark, and indeed hardly
thought he ever noticed her enough even
to observe the faults she might have.
But in his manner, just then, he was altogether
so unlike himself, and had so
much the appearance of offended ill
humour, that she would have thought
something particularly disagreeable had
just passed between the two friends,
except that she saw Pelham was, as
indeed he was always, perfectly mild and
composed.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>At that moment a very pretty woman,
dressed in the height of Parisian fashion,
came into the room; and, after acknowledging
Mr. Pelham with a familiar
bow, addressed Fitzhenry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How basely you have deserted me,
and forgotten our engagement. I have
been looking for you every where. The
waltz is nearly over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ten thousand pardons,” said Fitzhenry
rather embarrassed: “I am
quite ashamed, but really I had entirely
forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That does not mend the matter
much,” answered she, laughing, and
glancing at Emmeline. “You have, I
think, already forgotten your foreign gallantry;”
and, taking the arm he offered,
they both went into the dancing-room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who is that?” said Emmeline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>eagerly, as she followed them with her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is Mrs. Osterley,” replied Pelham.
“She is a Vienna acquaintance
of ours, and just returned from abroad.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline again breathed; but, complaining
of the heat of the tea-room,
got up and went towards the door.
Mr. Pelham smiled on her in compassion
as he drew her arm within his,
and suffered her to lead him which way
she chose, and they soon found themselves
among the crowd of waltzers.
Fitzhenry was then dancing with Mrs.
Osterley, and when they stopped, it was
close by Emmeline; though an intervening
waltzing pair, also pausing in
their giddy labours, hid her entirely from
their view.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who was that you were talking to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>in the tea-room when I went to claim
you so inconsiderately?” said Mrs.
Osterley to her partner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t you know?” answered he,
rather embarrassed by the question, or
rather by the manner in which it was
put; “it was Lady Fitzhenry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Fitzhenry! your wife! you
surprise me! what a very pretty woman
she is! I had heard her so differently
described; she is an uncommonly interesting
looking person, <i>vraiment je vous
en fais mon compliment</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry bowed; and Emmeline
could see that the mantling blood had
tinged even his forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And from what I further heard,”
continued his gay companion, looking
archly in his face, “I should have
thought you were the last man to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>been detected in a flirtation with your
wife; though really, now I have seen
her, I do not wonder she should have
made you a little <i>volage</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had gone in search of Pelham,”
said Fitzhenry, coldly, apparently much
disconcerted by her remark.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! is that the way of it?” retorted
Mrs. Osterley laughing: “well,
I really cannot pity you; it is but fair
play, for you richly deserve it. But
is Pelham really at last caught? Well,
I shall be truly curious to become acquainted
with the piece of perfection
who has had power to overcome his
impenetrable insensibility—pray do introduce
me to <i>your wife</i>.” And she again
laughed more heartily than before.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fitzhenry did not, as she seemed to
have expected, join in the laugh; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>with a smile of contempt, she added,
“Surely <i>you</i> don’t think it incumbent
upon you to play the English husband
and be angry, for that would be taking
a very unnecessary degree of trouble,
I should think.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Luckily, Pelham’s attention had, during
this conversation, been attracted another
way, so that Emmeline had gently withdrawn
her arm, and the crowd had soon
divided them. Disgusted with Mrs.
Osterley’s levity, and fearful that Fitzhenry
might perceive her, she drew back,
although she would have given much to
have heard his answer. She soon again
saw them in the giddy round, and went
to a seat which she observed to be un-occupied.</p>

<p class='c014'>She had not been there long, before
Miss Selina Danvers flew up to her, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>ecstasy in her looks, and a perfect parterre
of flowers in her head, and seizing
her hand vehemently, “Well, my dear
Lady Fitzhenry, here I am! actually at
Almacks! and all owing to you, I am
sure, I am more obliged to you than I can
express. What an enchanting place it is!
But only think how abominably those
odious lady patronesses have behaved!
After all, mamma has no ticket! Did you
ever hear any thing like it? It is quite
atrocious. I really thought I should have
died with anxiety when we came to
Willis’s room this morning to hear our
fate; and my heart sank within me when
I saw how full the street was of carriages,
for we got into a regular string just like
a ball—so delightful! We were there full
an hour and a half waiting, but I am sure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>it was well worth while, and I really
believe I screamed with joy when I saw
my ticket; but, as I said before, there
was none for mamma; so then we had to
drive all over the town to find a <i>chaperon</i>
for me to go with; at last we went to
Lady Coddrington, and only think! she
had got one for herself, and none for her
daughter! Did you ever hear any thing
so shocking! And she was so cross and
sulky about it at first, that she said she
would not go; but by abusing the lady
patronesses, we got her into good-humour,
and she agreed to take me;
but, between ourselves, she is a very
disagreeable <i>chaperon</i>; for out of spite,
I suppose, because her ugly daughter
could not get a ticket, she won’t try and
get me a partner; and, odious woman, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>came so late that the evening is already
more than half over. I suppose you
know all the men here, Lady Fitzhenry,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very few dancers,” said Emmeline,
not feeling at all inclined to press Selina
on any of her acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear! there is Mr. Moore!” exclaimed
the young lady, already in a
flutter of expectation; “and I do believe
he is coming this way; and we
danced constantly together at Arlingford,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That was true; but dancing and diverting
himself with the simple Selina at
Arlingford, and selecting her as his partner
at Almacks, were two very different
things; and after making her a distant,
chilling bow, Mr. Moore sat down on the
other side of Emmeline. Poor Selina’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>countenance fell. Moore went on talking,
<i>sotto-voce</i>, to Emmeline, till Selina
could bear it no longer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear, Mr. Moore! how come you not
to be dancing? I thought you liked it of
all things!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I may ask you the same question,”
returned he.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no, perhaps nobody has asked
me,” answered Selina, pettishly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is quite impossible; I will not
suppose any thing so disgraceful to the
taste and judgment of all the smart
young gentlemen I see here,” added he,
carelessly, and then returned to his affectedly
interesting conversation with
Emmeline, who listened apparently quite
unworthy of the honour conferred on her.
Selina saw with mortification that nothing
was to be hoped from Mr. Moore.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>But just then, a foppishly dressed young
man, coming up and speaking to Emmeline,
Selina’s spirits revived: she touched
her arm, whispering, “Who is that?
could you introduce me to him?” At
first Emmeline paid no attention, but Selina’s
pinches became so urgent, that she
at last was obliged to say: “Lord William
Vernon, will you allow me to introduce
my friend, Miss Danvers, to you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a minute, an expression of displeasure
animated Lord William’s unmeaning
countenance: he made Selina
a slight bow with his head, as he took a
hasty survey of her person; and after saying
something very uninteresting about
the heat of the room, to Emmeline, and
enlarging on the merits of a newly purchased
cabriolet-horse, to Moore, he
walked away.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Poor Selina bit her lip in vexation,
and finding she did not thrive at all in
her present situation, jumped up to see
what could be done with her cross <i>chaperon</i>,
whom she had spied in conversation
with a gentleman at the opposite
side of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How in the name of wonder came
Miss Danvers here?” exclaimed Moore, as
soon as she had left them—”what could
possess the lady patronesses to give her
a ticket?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I applied for one for her,” answered
Emmeline.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think that was rather a work of
supererogation on your part,” continued
Moore. “You surely are not going to
hamper yourself with that girl: you soon
frightened away Vernon, trembling for his
newly acquired dignity in the hierarchy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of fashion; and I must give you notice, if
you take to introducing Miss Selina Danvers
about, even you, even Lady Fitzhenry,
charming as she is, will be voted a
bore. What business has that sort of girl
here? and how can she be so unreasonable
as to expect to be asked to dance?
it is perfect nonsense—she had much better
stick to her Hampshire county ball;
there she may play <i>un grand rôle</i>. Misses
are really sad nuisances in society, unless
they sit quiet, and don’t trouble one;
so take my advice Lady Fitzhenry. Good-nature
is quite <i>mauvais ton</i> in London—it
is a bad style to take up, and will never
do. But it is impossible to sit still and
moralize when Collinet is playing that
waltz so delightfully; will you take a
turn or two with me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will resign the honour to Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Danvers,” said Emmeline, laughing—”and
luckily she is just coming this
way; so do the thing handsomely, and
ask the poor girl, for she knows nobody
here, and is dying to dance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, if you are really serious, I am
off,” said Moore, and hastily seizing his
hat, which he had hid under the seat
in preparation for his waltz with Lady
Fitzhenry, he hurried away.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although little inclined to merriment,
Emmeline could not help laughing—the
smile on her countenance caught Pelham’s
eye, and he came up to her to enquire
what had amused her. Emmeline
told Selina’s sad tale.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor thing!” said Pelham. “But
this is a new character Moore has taken up,
I think, for he set out much more wisely,
with the determination to enjoy every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>amusement that came in his way, professing
openly a love for dancing and
gaiety of every kind: but fashion, or
what is called, in its slang, <i>being fine</i>, is
so catching a disease that none can escape.
It has taken the place of the small-pox;
and I think it would be a good plan if
we could be inoculated for it, so as to secure
having it mildly, and of the best
sort. I don’t know how <i>you</i> manage to
be <i>what</i> and <i>where</i> you are in the world
without it; but pray don’t follow Moore’s
advice on the subject—let us have <i>one</i>
specimen of a good-natured London fine
lady. By the bye, I too have some advice
to give you, which is, not to make
up to that Mrs. Osterley: she was reckoned
at Vienna <i>a tres mauvaise langue</i>,
and was always making <i>tracasseries</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>She has a gay, and apparently an
artless manner, which at first takes one
in. Fitzhenry never liked her, so you
need not be acquainted with her; and
I should really counsel you to avoid
her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was little necessity to give
Emmeline that caution: what she had
already heard, had not prepossessed her
in Mrs. Osterley’s favour in any way;
but at that minute, the two people of
whom they were talking came up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Osterley begs to be introduced
to you, Lady Fitzhenry,” said her husband,
with an evident painful embarrassment
of manner. Emmeline got up,
and returned the salutation, though with
a coldness which she could not overcome,
but which did not seem at all to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>discompose the person to whom it was
addressed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“As an old friend of Lord Fitzhenry’s,”
continued Mrs. Osterley, “I
feel I have a right to claim acquaintance
with you, and I trust you will allow me
to endeavour to improve it.” And she
seated herself by Emmeline, who again
bowed in silence; for never before had
she felt so totally at a loss for some of
those usual phrases which mean nothing,
but which fill up the awkward pause, apt
to take place after a first introduction;
and Fitzhenry no way helped her. He
appeared to be completely discomposed;
and, under pretence of seeing an acquaintance,
removed to a distance. Mrs. Osterley
finding Emmeline did not speak,
continued:—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“It is so long since I have been in
England, that I hardly know any one:
quite a new set and generation have
started up; and my <i>English</i> acquaintances
are merely those whom I have
known abroad—by the bye, Mr. Pelham,
are the Mostyns in town?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe they have left it,” said he,
coldly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course you know them,” continued
Mrs. Osterley to Emmeline—”Mr.
Mostyn is so particular a friend
of Lord Fitzhenry’s.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I have never met them,” answered
Emmeline, commanding her
voice as well as she could, though she
felt her face was to a great degree betraying
her feelings.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You surprise me,” continued her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>tormenter. “But I suppose you and my
friend Lord Fitzhenry have been ruralizing,
and sentimentalizing alone in the
country, <i>à la mode Anglaise</i>, since your
marriage, and I cannot wonder at either
of you preferring that to the most agreeable
society,” added she, with a complimentary
smile. “After Easter, I suppose
every body will be in town; and I trust
Lady Florence will then return among
the number, for I really feel quite in a
strange country. I am now so little
used to the forms, and cold, stiff proprieties
of English ways, that, to tell the
truth, I find London very dull and stupid,
and was really delighted to-night,
when I saw Lord Fitzhenry, to talk over
delightful foreign days with him. Mr.
Pelham, don’t you find English society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>much changed for the worse? I think
my country folks are pleasanter any
where than in their own land; for, here
they directly put on their native buckram
again, and are so prodigiously good
and proper, that there is no living with
them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t agree with you,” replied Pelham.
“I am so stupid, as to like them
better at home: abroad, they are too
apt to cast off some of the restraints
which the opinions of their own country
oblige them to submit to, without adopting
those of the nations they visit. In
short, the case is the same with manners
as with religion;—they cease to be protestants
without becoming catholics; and
they take advantage of the usual laxity
of morals and principles of other countries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>without acquiring that outward
decorum of manner, which at least prevents
such conduct from offending the
innocent; without, in short, adopting
that excusable hypocrisy, which a French
author so justly calls <i>l’hommage que le vice
rend à la vertu</i>, an English woman rarely
ceases to be virtuous, without becoming
coarse; a foreigner may understand <i>le
metier</i> better, but my own opinion is—that
there are few of my countrywomen
much the better for a long residence on
the continent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The present company always excepted,
of course,” said Mrs. Osterley,
bowing to him. “Mr. Pelham is no
complimenter, as I dare say you find,
Lady Fitzhenry; for I believe you have
the pleasure of being intimately acquainted
with him.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Fortunately for Emmeline, a new
waltz just then began; and Fitzhenry,
to make up for his former negligence,
came again to claim Mrs. Osterley as
his partner, although seemingly against
his will. As they went away together,
Emmeline heard her say to Fitzhenry—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not sure I admire your Lady
Fitzhenry so much on nearer view as I did
at first sight. She is terribly <i>English</i>; so
cold and distant—and I see already she
dislikes me for being the reverse; <i>et que
je n’ai pas l’honneur de lui plaire</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>What Fitzhenry replied, Emmeline
did not hear; and, as it was now late,
and that she was wearied both in body
and mind, she begged of Pelham to ask
for her carriage, desiring him to tell
Lady Saville she would send it back for
her, if she had not ordered her own.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>They crossed the room in silence:
poor Emmeline taking one last look of
Fitzhenry, as he was still waltzing with
Mrs. Osterley.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is a spiteful little devil,” said
Pelham, who well knew whither Emmeline’s
eyes had wandered; “and I again
advise you to keep clear of her; she
hates both Fitzhenry and me; for, the
truth is, she tried to turn both our heads
alternately, and succeeded with neither:
Fitzhenry had too much good taste to be
taken in by any thing so glaring.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Emmeline made no comment, but
sighed deeply. Her sigh was echoed
by one close to her; and, turning round,
she saw poor Selina, cloaked up to her
ears, following her hard-hearted <i>chaperon</i>
down the stairs which she had so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>lately mounted in such glee; the evening
to which she had looked forward
so long, with so much ecstasy, already
over—and having to her been productive
of nothing but mortification and
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good night, Lady Fitzhenry,” said
she, sadly:—”for you see I am going:
but I am sure I don’t care; there is nobody
here one knows, and though it is
a ball, nobody <i>will</i> dance: it is the
oddest thing I ever saw. However, it is
very well to come once, just to be able
to say one has been at Almacks, for that
sounds well; but I declare I think it
the stupidest place I ever was at, and I
wonder how people can make such a fuss
about it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The loud welcome cry of “Lady Fitzhenry’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>carriage stops the way,” prevented
any more of Selina’s peevishness
being heard, and Emmeline returned to
her solitary home. But harmless, unpresuming,
and innocent as she was, in
absenting herself, she had left her character
behind her; and from that evening,
(thanks to Mrs. Osterley,) all London
talked of and laughed at the decided <i>affair</i>
between Lady Fitzhenry and Mr.
Pelham; each narrator telling his own
story, and inventing such facts as each
found wanting to render it plausible.
Emmeline, however, lost nothing in the
good opinion of the fashionable world by
this report, which was treated, by some,
as an excellent joke; by others, as a
thing of course; and many of those who
thus carelessly discussed the matter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and at once deprived poor Emmeline of
her good name, might have ended their
remarks, if they had had honest consciences,
with Lady Saville’s first words
of praise to Emmeline: “She is really
quite on a par with ourselves.”</p>

<div class='lh'>

<p class='c014'>“Flirtation” is not merely the title, but the prevailing genius of this
novel; as indeed it ought to be. The noble authoress follows her subject,
and never wanders from it; every incident is metamorphosed into
it. How redolent of flirtation is every chapter! What an entireness of
subject pervades every line! Flirtation on the part of men; flirtation
on the part of women; flirtation abroad; flirtation at home; flirtation
in low life, and in high life; flirtation among the single, and among the
married; private flirtation, and public flirtation; and many phases more
than we have room to enumerate of the same vice. If this picture
should fail in reforming the male coquets who indulge in it, we entertain
confident hopes that the fair will listen to her Ladyship’s exhortations,
and be taught to renounce so dangerous a pastime.”—<span class='sc'>New

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
